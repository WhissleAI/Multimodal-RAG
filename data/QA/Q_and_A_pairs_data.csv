It does not have a clear cut economic philosophy, is divided within, and has been saddled with a good deal of corruption and poor appointments, leading to a loss of its idealistic spirit."
How has President Zuma's leadership affected the ANC?,"President Zuma's leadership has not provided the kind of leadership that the country needs. He has been very concerned and consumed with his own situation, protecting himself against charges of corruption, surrounding himself with very loyal people, but he hasn't provided clear leadership on the economy. Unfortunately, he has done very little to stem the corruption, which has left the ANC in some disarray. There is unhappiness within the ANC, but there are elements that brought him to power against Thabo Mbeki and don't know what to do."
What are the chances of recalling President Zuma from his position?,"The fact that the only action against an incumbent in a one-party or one-and-a-half-party state is to recall him is a sad commentary.

This level of participation requires a high need for speed, which extends beyond co-location, as high frequency traders are willing to pay for any microsecond advantage they can get, even between different exchanges. For instance, a fiber optic cable linking the New York Stock Exchange servers in New Jersey and Nasdaq servers in Qatar is being replaced with a higher speed network, which will reduce the round trip time for price information from 780 microseconds to 350 microseconds, potentially worth millions to a high frequency trader."

The study found that drug-resistant bacteria cause 2.8 million infections and 35,000 deaths each year in the US."
How does the overuse of antibiotics contribute to antibiotic resistance?,"The overuse of antibiotics contributes to antibiotic resistance by killing off susceptible bacteria, leaving behind resistant bacteria that can multiply and spread. This happens in both human medicine and agriculture, where antibiotics are often used to promote growth and prevent disease in animals. The misuse and overuse of antibiotics make it harder to treat infections and increase the risk of dangerous, drug-resistant infections."
Why is it difficult to develop new antibiotics?,"Developing new antibiotics is difficult for several reasons. First, it takes a long time and is very expensive to bring a new drug to market, often taking 10-15 years and costing over $1 billion. Second, bacteria can evolve quickly and develop resistance to new drugs, making them less effective over time. Third, there is less financial incentive for drug companies to invest in antibiotic research because antibiotics are typically used for short periods of time and are less profitable than other drugs, such as those for chronic conditions. As a result, there have been few new antibiotics developed in recent decades, and the pipeline for new drugs is limited."
What are some of the strategies recommended to combat antibiotic resistance?,"Some strategies recommended to combat antibiotic resistance include improving surveillance and tracking of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, promoting the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and agriculture, developing new antibiotics and alternative therapies, and investing in research and development. Public awareness campaigns and education initiatives can also help reduce the demand for antibiotics and promote better hygiene and infection control practices. Additionally, international cooperation and collaboration are essential to address the global threat of antibiotic resistance and prevent the spread of drug-resistant bacteria across borders."
