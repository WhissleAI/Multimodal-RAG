LOST LOVED ONES IN MASS.SHOOTINGS..CHRIS JANSING IS ON THE NORTH.LAWN..CHRIS, GIVE US DETAILS OF WHAT.THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO.ANNOUNCE..>> Reporter: THE BIGGEST THING.IS TO TRY TO EXPAND BACKGROUND.CHECKS..WE KNOW THAT IN STATES THAT HAVE.UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECK, GUN.DEATHS HAVE GONE OUT..HE WILL EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF.WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GUN DEALER.BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO.BE LICENSED IF YOU HAVE TO BE.LICENSED, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO.DO A BACKGROUND CHECK..RIGHT NOW ABOUT 40% OF GUN SALES.DO NOT REQUIRE THAT..SO BY TOUGHENING UP THESE.REGULATIONS, THEY CAN HAVE MORE.PEOPLE CHECKED OUT BEFORE.THEY'RE ABLE TO GET A GUN..DO THAT, THEY WILL ALSO HAVE TO.ADD NEW FBI AGENTS..THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR MONEY.THERE CONGRESS TO MORE ATF.AGENTS, AS WELL..REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS AND ON.THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL HAVE BEEN.VERY MUCH AGAINST THIS, THEY SAY.THAT THIS IS THE PRESIDENT.TAKING MATTERS INTO HIS OWN.HANDS..CHRIS CHRISTIE CALLED HIM A.PETULANT CHILD..BUT TODAY, THIS IS THE PRESIDENT.MAKING HIS CASE TO THE AMERICAN.PEOPLE WHO LARGELY SUPPORT.BACKGROUND CHECKS IN GENERAL,.LESTER..>> ALL RIGHT..AND THE PRESIDENT ABOUT TO.SPEAK..HE'S BEING INTRODUCED BY NEWTOWN.FATHER WHO LOST HIS 7-YEAR-OLD.SON, DANIEL, IN THE MASSACRE AT.SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY IN 2012..AS I SAID, HE WILL INTRODUCE THE.PRESIDENT..LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT HE'S.SAYING..>> HERE WITH MY FAMILY AND VICE.PRESIDENT BIDEN, LISTENING TO.OUR PRESIDENT SPEAK, AND OUR.FEELINGS OF DESPAIR WERE.REPLACED WITH FEELINGS OF HOPE..AND I REMEMBER THINKING WHO WILL.HELP HIM WITH THIS?.IT'S A TALL ORDER..SO SINCE THEN, I'VE COME TO KNOW.AND RESPECT AND LEARN FROM MANY.AMAZING INDIVIDUALS AND.ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE DOING GOOD.SMART WORK IN THIS SPACE..AND MANY OF YOU ARE RIGHT HERE.RIGHT NOW..MANY FOLKS IN THE GUN VIOLENCE.PREVENTION COALITION HAVE HAD.NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH VICE.PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRESIDENT.OBAMA AND THEIR TOP ADVISERS TO.ADDRESS THIS ISSUE..BUT WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE..AND THE PRESIDENT CAN'T DO IT.ALONE..THE THING IS, EVERY GUN-RELATED.DEATH IS PREVENTABLE..AND WE NEED YOUR HELP..WE NEED EVERYBODY ENGAGED IN.THIS..PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE A PROMISE.AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AND A.PROMISE AS A FATHER THAT HE.WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER.TO PROTECT OUR THAGS'S CHILDREN,.TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER.AND CURB THE LOSS OF LIFE TO GUN.VIOLENCE IN AMERICA..SO TODAY, WE CELEBRATE ANOTHER.EXAMPLE OF HOW PRESIDENT OBAMA.AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN.CONTINUE TO KEEP THAT PROMISE..IT IS WITH SUCH GREAT HONOR THAT.I INTRODUCE TO YOU THE PRESIDENT.OF THE UNITED STATES, BARACK.OBAMA, AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE.BIDEN..[ APPLAUSE ].>> THE PRESIDENT ENTERING THE.ROOM AFTER APPLAUSE..AGAIN, THERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS.HERE WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES IN.MASS SHOOTINGS..MARK OF COURSE THE FATHER OF A.7-YEAR-OLD KILLED..DEBBIE GIFFORDS THERE ALSO..OF COURSE FIVE YEARS AGO SHE WAS.WOUNDED IN A MASS SHOOTING.DURING AN EVENT AT A SHOPPING.CENTER..>> THANK YOU..THANK YOU, EVERYBODY..THANK YOU..THANK YOU, EVERYBODY..PLEASE HAVE A SEAT..THANK YOU..THANK YOU, EVERYBODY..THANK YOU..THANK YOU, EVERYBODY..PLEASE, PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT..THANK YOU SO MUCH..MARK, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR.YOUR INTRODUCTION..I STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME.WE MET, AND THE TIME WE SPENT.TOGETHER..AND THE CONVERSATION WE HAD.ABOUT DANIEL..AND THAT CHANGED ME THAT DAY..AND MY HOPE EARNESTLY HAS BEEN.THAT IT WOULD CHANGE THE.COUNTRY..FIVE YEARS AGO THIS WEEK, A.SITTING MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND.18 OTHERS WERE SHOT AT AT A.SUPERMARKET IN TUCSON, ARIZONA..IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME I HAD.HAD TO TALK TO THE NATION IN.RESPONSE TO A MASS SHOOTING,.NOR.WOULD IT BE THE LAST..FT. HOOD..BINGHAMTON..AURORA..OAK CREEK..NEWTOWN..THE NAVY YARD..SAN BERNARDINO..CHARLESTON..TOO MANY..>> TOO MANY..>> THANKS TO A GREAT MEDICAL.TEAM AND THE LOVE OF HER.HUSBAND, MARK, MY DEAR FRIEND.AND COLLEAGUE, GABBY GIFFORDS,.SURVIVED..SHE'S HERE WITH US TODAY WITH.HER WONDERFUL MOM..[ APPLAUSE ].>> THANKS TO A GREAT MEDICAL.TEAM, HER WONDERFUL HUSBAND,.MARK, WHO BY THE WAY THE LAST.TIME I MET WITH MARK, THIS THIS.IS JUST A SMALL ASIDE, YOU MAY.KNOW MARK'S TWIN BROTHER IS IN.OUTER SPACE..HE CAME TO THE OFFICE, AND I.SAID HOW OFTEN ARE YOU TALKING.TO HIM AND HE SAID I USUALLY.TALK TO HIM EVERY DAY, BUT THE.CALL WAS COMING IN RIGHT BEFORE.THE MEETING, SO I THINK I MAY.HAVE NOT ANSWERED HIS CALL..WHICH MADE ME FEEL KIND OF BAD..THAT'S A LONG DISTANCE CALL..SO I TOLD HIM IF HIS BROTHER.SCOTT IS CALLING TODAY, THAT HE.SHOULD TAKE IT..TURN THE RINGER ON..I WAS THERE WITH GABY WHEN SHE.WAS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL..AND WE DIDN'T THINK NECESSARILY.AT THAT POINT THAT SHE WAS GOING.TO SURVIVE..AND THAT VISIT RIGHT BEFORE.MEMORIAL, ABOUT AN HOUR LATER,.GABY FIRST OPENED HER EYES..BUT I KNOW THE PAIN THAT SHE AND.HER FAMILY HAVE ENDURED THESE.PAST FIVE YEARS..AND THE REHABILITATION AND THE.WORK AND THE EFFORT TO RECOVER.FROM SHATTERING INJURIES..AND THEN I THINK OF ALL THE.AMERICANS WHO AREN'T AS.FORTUNATE..EVERY SINGLE YEAR, MORE THAN.30,000 AMERICANS HAVE THEIR.LIVES CUT SHORT BY GUNS..30,000..SUICIDES, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,.GANG SHOOT-OUTS, ACCIDENTS..HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF.AMERICANS HAVE LOST BROTHERS AND.SISTERS..OR BURIED THEIR OWN CHILDREN..MANY HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO LIVE.WITH A DISABILITY OR LEARN TO.LIVE WITHOUT THE LOVE OF THEIR.LIFE..A NUMBER OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE.HERE TODAY..THEY CAN TELL YOU SOME STORIES..IN THIS ROOM RIGHT HERE, THERE.ARE A LOT OF STORIES..THERE IS A LOT OF HEARTACHE..THERE A LOT OF RESILIENCE, A LOT.OF STRENGTH, BUT THERE IS ALSO A.LOT OF PAIN..AND THIS IS JUST A SMALL.SAMPLING..THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS.NOT THE ONLY COUNTRY ON EARTH.WITH VIOLENT OR DANGEROUS.PEOPLE..WE ARE NOT INHERENTLY MORE.REASON TO VIOLENCE..BUT WE ARE THE ONLY ADVANCED.COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT SEES THIS.KIND OF MASS VIOLENCE ERUPT WITH.THIS KIND OF FREQUENCY..IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN OTHER.ADVANCED COUNTRIES..IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE..AND AS I SAID BEFORE, SOMEHOW.WE'VE BECOME NUMB TO IT AND WE.START POSITIONING THAT THIS IS.NORMAL..AND INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT.HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM, THIS.HAS BECOME ONE OF OUR MOST.POLARIZED PARTISAN DEBATES..DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE IS A.GENERAL CONSENSUS IN AMERICA.ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE..THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY ON.THURSDAY I'M GOING TO HOLD A.TOWN HALL MEETING IN VIRGINIA ON.GUN VIOLENCE..BECAUSE MY GOAL HERE IS TO BRING.GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE.ISSUE TOGETHER FOR AN OPEN.DISCUSSION..I'M NOT ON THE BALLOT AGAIN..I'M NOT LOOKING TO SCORE SOME.POINTS..I THINK WE CAN DISAGREE WITHOUT.IMPUGNING OTHER PEOPLE'S MOTIVES.OR WITHOUT BEING DISAGREEABLE..WE DON'T NEED TO BE TALKING PAST.ONE ANOTHER..BUT WE DO HAVE TO FEEL A SENSE.OF URGENCY ABOUT IT..IN DR. KING'S WORD, WE HAVE TO.FEEL THE URGENCY OF NOW..BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DYING..AND THE CONSTANT EXCUSES FOR.INACTION NO LONGER DO..NO LONGER SUFFICE..THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY..NOT TO DEBATE THE LAST MASS.SHOOTING, BUT DO SOMETHING TO.TRY TO PREVENT THE NEXT ONE..[ APPLAUSE ].TO PROVE TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF.AMERICANS, EVEN IF OUR VOICES.AREN'T ALWAYS THE LOUDEST OR.MOST EXTREME, WE CARE ENOUGH.ABOUT A LITTLE BOY LIKE DANIEL.TO COME TOGETHER AND TAKE COMMON.SENSE STEPS TO SAVE LIVES AND.PROTECT MORE OF OUR CHILDREN..NOW, I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY.CLEAR AT THE START..I'VE SAID THIS OVER AND OVER.AGAIN..THIS ALSO BECOMES ROUTINE..THERE IS A RITUAL ABOUT THIS.WHOLE THING THAT I HAVE TO DO..I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND.AMENDMENT..IT'S THERE WRITTEN ON THE PAPER..IT GUARANTEES A RIGHT TO BEAR.ARMS..NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES PEOPLE.TRY TO TWIST MY WORDS AROUND, I.TAUGHT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, I.KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS..I GET IT..BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN.FIND WAYS TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE.CONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND.AMENDMENT..I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT..WE ALL BELIEVE IN THE FIRST.AMENDMENT, THE GUARANTEE OF FREE.SPEECH..BUT WE ACCEPT THAT YOU CAN'T.YELL ""FIRE"" IN A THEATER..WE UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME.CONSTRAINTS ON OUR FREEDOM IN.ORDER TO PROTECT INNOCENT.PEOPLE..WE CHERISH OUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY,.BUT WE ACCEPT THAT YOU HAVE TO.GO THROUGH METAL DETECTORS.BEFORE BEING ALLOWED TO BOARD A.PLANE..IT'S NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE.DOING THAT..BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS.PART OF THE PRICE OF LIVING IN A.CIVILIZED SOCIETY..AND WHAT IS OFTEN IGNORED IN.THIS DEBATE IS THAT A MAJORITY.OF GUN OWNERS ACTUALLY AGREE..A MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS AGREE.THAT WE CAN RESPECT THE SECOND.AMENDMENT WHILE KEEPING AN.IRRESPONSIBLE LAW-BREAKING FEW.FROM INFLICTING HARM ON A.MASSIVE SCALE..TODAY BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE.REQUIRED AT GUN STORES..IF A FATHER WANTS TO TEACH HIS.DAUGHTER HOW TO HUNT, HE CAN.WALK INTO A GUN STORE, GET A.BACKGROUND CHECK, PURCHASE HIS.WEAPON SAFELY AND RESPONSIBLY..THIS IS NOT SEEN AS AN.INFRINGEMENT ON THE SECOND.AMENDMENT..CONTRARY TO THE CLAIMS OF WHAT.SOME GUN RIGHTS PROPONENTS HAVE.SUGGESTED, THIS HASN'T BEEN THE.FIRST STEP IN SOME SLIPPERY.SLOPE TO MASS CONFISCATION..CONTRARY TO CLAIMS OF SOME.PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.APPARENTLY BEFORE THIS MEETING,.THIS IS NOT A PLOT TO TAKE AWAY.EVERYBODY'S GUNS..YOU PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK, YOU.PURCHASE A FIREARM..THE PROBLEM IS SOME GUN SELLERS.HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER A.DIFFERENT SET OF RULES..A VIOLENT FELON CAN BUY THE.EXACT SAME WEAPON OVER THE.INTERNET WITH NO BACKGROUND.CHECK, NO QUESTIONS ASKED..A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT ABOUT.1 IN 30 PEOPLE LOOKING TO BUY.GUNS ON ONE WEBSITE HAD CRIMINAL.RECORDS..1 OUT OF 30 HAD A CRIMINAL.RECORD..WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS.CONVICTED OF SERIOUS CRIME,.AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, DOMESTIC.VIOLENCE, ROBBERY, ILLEGAL GUN.POSSESSION..PEOPLE WITH LENGTHY CRIMINAL.HISTORIES BUYING DEADLY WEAPONS.ALL TOO EASILY..AND THIS WAS JUST ONE WEBSITE.WITHIN THE SPAN OF A FEW MONTHS..SO WE'VE CREATED A SYSTEM IN.WHICH DANGEROUS PEOPLE ARE.ALLOWED TO PLAY BY A DIFFERENT.SET OF RULES THAN A RESPONSIBLE.GUN OWNER WHO BUYS HIS OR HER.GUN THE RIGHT WAY AND SUBJECTS.THEMSELVES TO A BACKGROUND.CHECK..IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE..EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE TO ABIDE.BY THE SAME RULES..MOST AMERICANS AND GUN OWNERS.AGREE..AND THAT IS WHAT WE TRIED TO.CHANGE THREE YEARS AGO AFTER 26.AMERICANS, INCLUDING 20.CHILDREN, WERE MURDERED AT SANDY.HOOK ELEMENTARY..TWO UNITED STATES SENATOR, JOE.MANCHIN, A DEMOCRAT FROM WEST.VIRGINIA, AND PAT TOOMEY, A.REPUBLICAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA,.BOTH GUN OWNER, STRONG DEFENDERS.OF OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS,.BOTH WITH A-GRADES FROM THE N.RA, THAT'S HARD TO GET, WORK.TOGETHER IN GOOD FAITH AND.CONSULTING WITH FOLKS LIKE OUR.VICE PRESIDENT, WHO HAS BEEN A.CHAMPION ON THIS FOR A LONG.TIME, TO WRITE A COMMON SENSE.COMPROMISE BILL THAT WOULD HAVE.REQUIRED VIRTUALLY EVERYONE WHO.BUYS A GUN TO GET A BACKGROUND.CHECK..THAT WAS IT..PRETTY COMMON SENSE STUFF..90% OF AMERICANS SUPPORTED THAT.IDEA..90% OF DEMOCRATS IN THE IS THAT.THE SENATE VOTED FOR THAT IDEA..BUT IT FAILED..BECAUSE 90% OF REPUBLICANS IN.THE SENATE VOTED AGAINST THAT.IDEA..HOW DID THIS BECOME SUCH A.PARTISAN ISSUE?.REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT GEORGE W..BUSH ONCE SAID I BELIEVE IN.BACKGROUND CHECKS AT GUN SHOWS.OR ANYWHERE TO MAKE SURE GUNS.DON'T GET INTO THE HANDS OF.PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM..SENATOR JOHN McCAIN INTRODUCED A.BIPARTISAN MEASURE TO ADDRESS.THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE SAYING WE.NEED THIS AMENDMENT BECAUSE.CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS HAVE.EXPLOITED AND ARE EXPLOITING.THIS VERY OBVIOUS LOOPHOLE IN.OUR GUN SAFETY LAWS..EVEN THE NRA USED TO SUPPORT.EXPANDED BACKGROUND CHECKS..AND BY THE WAY MOST OF ITS.MEMBERS STILL DO..MOST REPUBLICAN VOTERS STILL DO..HOW DID WE GET HERE?.HOW IT WE DID WE GET TO THE.PLACE WHERE REQUIRING A.COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK.MEANS TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S GUNS?.EACH TIME THIS COMES UP, WE ARE.FED THE EXCUSE THAT COMMON SENSE.REFORMS LIKE BACKGROUND CHECKSB.AWAY PEOPLE'S GUNS?.EACH TIME THIS COMES UP, WE ARE.FED THE EXCUSE THAT COMMON SENSE.REFORMS LIKE BACKGROUND CHECKS.MIGHT NOT HAVE STOPPED THE LAST.MASSACRE..OR THE ONE BEFORE THAT..OR THE ONE BEFORE THAT..SO WHY BOTHER TRYING..I REJECT THAT THINKING..[ APPLAUSE ].WE KNOW WE CAN'T STOP EVERY ACT.OF EVIL IN THE WORLD, BUT MAYBE.WE COULD TRY TO STOP ONE ACT OF.EVIL, ONE AGENT OF VIOLENCE..SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL THAT AT.THE SAME TIME THAT SANDY HOOK.HAPPENED, A DISTURBED PERSON IN.CHINA TOOK A KNIFE AND TRIED TO.KILL WITH A KNIFE A

It is not recommended as.      the first medication.      to treat diabetes....  ...and should not be used in.  people with type 1 diabetes.   or diabetic ketoacidosis..

Do not take INVOKANA®.           if you have.    severe kidney problems or.         are on dialysis..Stop taking and call your doctor.        right away if you.       experience symptoms.     such as rash, swelling,.     or difficulty breathing.          or swallowing..

RELEASERELEASED..ROSA FLORES IS FOLLOWING THIS.STORY FROM CHICAGO..YOU HAVE SEEN THE VIDEO..TELL US ABOUT IT, ROSA..>> PAMELA, IT COMES DOWN TO TEN.SECONDS OF VIDEO..LET ME STTAKE YOU THROUGH THIS..WHAT YOU SEE INITIALLY IS.CEDRICK CHAPMAN GETTING OUT OF.HIS VEHICLE AND START A SPRINT.AWAY FROM POLICE..YOU CAN SEE THAT HE SQUEEZES.BETWEEN TWO CARS AND THERE'S A.POLICE OFFICER TRAILING RIGHT.BEHIND HIM..HE'S JUST A FEW FEET AWAY FROM.C.CHAPMAN..>> WE'RE SHOWING IT NOW..>> THEN YOU SEE THE OTHER POLICE.OFFICER..THE SHOOTING POLICE OFFICER.ACTUALLY AIMING AT CHAPMAN..THIS HAPPENS VERY QUICKLY IN.ABOUT TEN SECONDS..THEN AFTER THAT ALL YOU SEE ONCE.THE ANGLE OF THAT CAMERA.CHANGES, YOU SEE CHAPMAN ON THE.GROUND..BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WE HEARD.THIS STORY BEFORE THE.DESCRIPTION OF THE VIDEO..THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT.WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING THIS.VIDEO..I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU ONE OF.THE -- PROBABLY THE MOST.DISTURBING PART IS TOWARDS THE.END....IF YOU KEEP PLAYING THIS, YOU.SEE THE POLICE OFFICER PLACE HIS.FOOT ON TOP OF THE BODY..NOW FROM TALKING TO AN.INVESTIGATOR WHO WAS ACTUALLY.FIRED AFTER HE DECIDED THAT THIS.WAS NOT A JUSTIFIED SHOOTING, HE.TELLS US HAD THAT WHAT HAPPENED.AFTER IS THE OFFICER HANDCUFFED.CHAPMAN AND THEN WHAT YOU SEE IN.THAT VIDEO IS THIS POLICE.OFFICER PLACES HIS FOOT ON TOP.OF HIS BODY..>> SO WALK US THROUGH THIS.AGAIN..WE JUST SAW SOME CLIPS

STARTS RUNNING AWAY FROM.POLICE OFFICERS..YOU SEE HIM KIND OF SQUEEZE IN.BETWEEN TWO VEHICLES AND THERE'S.A POLICE OFFICER RIGHT BEHIND.HIM..THAT POLICE OFFICER IS STILL.FOLLOWING HIM AS CHAPMAN.CONTINUES RUNNING ON THE.SIDEWALK..HE'S GOING TO TURN THE CORNER.THERE..A PART OF THIS WE DON'T QUITE.SEE BECAUSE THE FRAMING OF THAT.SHOT CHANGES..BUT YOU DO SEE THE SHOOTING.POLICE OFFICER AND HE IS WITH.HIS GUN DRAWN FOLLOWING CHAPMAN..THEN YOU SEE THAT OFFICER AT THE.INTERSECTION AND THEN ONCE THE.ANGLE OF THAT CAMERA CHANGING,.YOU DO SEE CHAPMAN ON THE GROUND.AND THE OTHER POLICE OFFICER.WITH HIS FOOT ON TOP OF HIS.BODY..NOW WE GOT TO TELL THE OFFICER'S.SIDE OF THE STORY..THE OFFICERS HAVE SAID THEY.FEARED FOR THEIR LIVES..THEY FELT THAT CHAPMAN TURNED.AROUND AND THAT THEY WERE IN.FEAR FOR THEIR LIFE AND HAD A.BLACK OBJECT..THE OBJECT WAS AN iPHONE BOX AND.THERE WAS NO WEAPON EVER.RECOVERED ON THE SCENE OTHER.THAN THAT iPHONE BOX THAT.CHAPMAN WAS HOLDING AND THAT WAS.RECOVERED LATER ON THE SCENE..>> I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS.WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY.CHARLES COLEMAN JR., TRIAL.ATTORNEY..THE FAMILY OF CEDRICK CHAPMAN.PUSH ED FOR THIS VUD OWE TO BE.RELEASED AS PART OF A WRONGFUL.DEATH LAWSUIT..THE CITY OPPOSED IT WHILE COURT.HEARINGS WERE UNDERWAY AND THEN.DID AN ABOUT FACE AND WANTED IT.TO BE RELEASED AS OF LAST NIGHT..WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?.WAS THAT THE RIGHT THING TO.RELEASE IT?.>> I DO THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT.THING TO RELEASE THE TAPE....HOWEVER, THE CITY'S MANEUVERING.STRIKES ME AS BEING A LOT OF PR.SPIN..WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO OR.WHAT IS SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE.TRYING TO DO IS IN LIEU OF ALL.THE POLICE SHOOTINGS WE HAVE.SEEN, WE SEE McDONALD, RONALD.JOHNSON AND NOW THIS CEDRICK.CHAMPIONSHIPMAN SHOOTING....WITH ALL THESE THINGS THAT HAVE.HAPPENED, HIS OFFICE HAS TAKEN A.TERRIBLE HIT WITH RESPECT TO.POLICE CORRUPTION AND ABUSE OF.FORCE IN CHICAGO..SO WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO.NOW IS SUGGEST WE WANT TO BE.TRANSPARENT AND OPEN WITH THE.COMMUNITY, BUT IT REALLY SORT OF.SEEMS LIKE WHAT HE'S TRYING TO.DO IS SAVE FACE WITH THE.CITIZENS OF CHICAGO..>> WERE YOU ABLE TO WATCH THE.VIDEO THAT WE JUST SHOWED?.>> I DID..I SAW IT AS ONE OF THE THINGS.THAT SOME OF THE LAWYERS FOR THE.CITY WAS ARGUING IS THE VIDEO.WASN'T CLEAR AND WOULDN'T BE.ABLE TO MAKE OUT WHAT ACTUALLY.HAPPENED..IN HIS ORDER THE JUDGE WAS VERY.CLEAR..THE JUDGE WAS IRRITATED THAT THE.CITY SORT OF DID THIS ABOUT.FACE..IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE JUDGE.WAS ALSO CLEAR THAT WHILE THE.VIDEO MAY NOT BE CLEAR, YOU CAN.SEE MORE THAN WHAT THE LAWYERS.FROM THE CITY OF CHICAGO WERE.TRYING TO SUGGEST WOULD BE ABLE.TO BE SEEN ON THE VIDEO..>> AND THE FEDERAL JUDGE IN HAD.THIS CASE THAT YOU JUST TALKED.ABOUT HE DID NOT MINCE WORDS.CALLING THE ACTION IRRESPONSIBLE.IN THIS CASE IN A WASTE OF.TAXPAYER'S MONEY AND THE COURT'S.TIME..DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?.>> I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT.IT IN TERMS OF WHAT IT IS.JUDICIALLY IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH.THIS COST THE CITY, HOW MUCH.TIME AND RESOURCES HAVE GONE.INTO NOT ONLY PAYING FOR THE.LAWYERS OR FIGHTING THIS CASE IN.COURT, BUT ALSO JUST THE LAW.THAT IT CREATES IN THE JUSTICE.SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE JUDGE.LOOKING AT THE CASE..IT'S SOMETHING THEY SHOULD BE.REPRIMANDED ABOUT BECAUSE IF IT.WAS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, IF IT.WAS ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND.CHICAGO KNOWING WHAT ACTUALLY.HAPPENED, THEY COULD HAVE.RELEASED ANY SORT OF FIGHT AND.STOPPED THAT EARLY ON..INSTEAD THEY WAIT UNTIL THE 11th.HOUR AND DECIDE AT THAT POINT.THEY ARE GOING TO BE OKAY WITH.THE VIDEO BEING RELEASED..I DO UNDERSTAND THE JUDGE'S.FRUSTRATIONS AND I'M INCLINED TO.AGREE..IF THIS WAS THE POSITION FROM.THE VERY BEGINNING, FROM THE.OUTSET THEN THAT SHOULD HAVE.BEEN THEY WERE ARGUING..>> QUICKLY BEFORE..I GO BACK TO ROSA, DO YOU THINK.THE OFFICERS HAVE A CASE HERE?.THEY SAY THAT WE WERE RUNNING.AFTER THIS GUY..HE JUST STOLE A CAR..WE BELIEVED HE HAD A GUN AND WE.FELT THREATENED FOR OUR LIVES..>> AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, I.HAVE SEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT.THINGS..WHEN I LOOK AT THIS VIDEO AND.HEAR THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT IS.BEING SAID, IT'S DIFFICULT R FOR.ME TO TO BELIEVE THAT THESE.OFFICERS CAN ARTICULATE THEY.WERE IN FEAR OF THEIR LIVES..AS THIS 17-YEAR-OLD UNARMED.YOUNG BLACK MAN IS RUNNING AWAY.FROM THEM, HE'S SHOT IN THE BACK.BY POLICE WHO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY.TO TAKE AIM AT HIM AND FIRE..I HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME.BELIEVING THAT..I THINK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT.IT IN TERMS OF THE LAW, THEY.HAVE TROUBLE ARTICULATING WHAT.THEY SAW AS A PERCEIVED THREAT.TO THEIR LIFE THAT WOULD CAUSE.THEM TO UNHOLSTER THEIR FIREARM.AND THEN DISCHARGE THEIR FIREARM.TO AN UNARMED YOUNG MAN..WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE.THOUGHT HE HAD A BLACK OBJECT IN.HIS HAND..THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS..IT WAS AN iPHONE BOX..I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE.THESE OFFICERS HAVE MUCH TO.STAND ON IN TERMS OF THE.SHOOTING..I AGREE WITH THE OFFICER IN.CHICAGO WHO SUGGESTED THAT THEY.TURN THE RULING ON THIS AROUND..THIS SHOOTING WAS CLEARLY.UNJUSTIFIED..>> AND I WANT TO BRING ROSA BACK.IN TO GET THE REACTION IN.CHICAGO AND ALSO LEARN MORE.ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS..>> I THINK THE IMPLICATIONS ARE.VERY HIGH BECAUSE IN THIS.PARTICULAR CASE, NOT ONLY ARE WE.TALKING ABOUT AN.OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING LIKE.WE HAVE SEEN IN OTHER CASES, BUT.IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE YOU'VE.GOT AN INVESTIGATOR THAT.INVESTIGATES EVERY.OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING, YOU.HAVE AN INVESTIGATOR WHO WAS.FIRED BECAUSE HE SAYS THAT HAD.HE WAS GOING TO DEEM THIS.PARTICULAR SHOOTING UNJUSTIFIED..HE WAS ASKED TO CHANGE IT TO.JUSTIFIED..NOW THAT ORGANIZATION, THE HEAD.OF THAT ORGANIZATION IS.APPOINTED BY THE MAYOR OF.CHICAGO..NOW AFTER THE LA-QUAN McDONALD.AND THE RELEASE OF THAT VIDEO.SHS THE HEAD OF THAT.ORGANIZATION RESIGNED..THE MAYOR ASKED HIM TO STEP.DOWN..THAT'S ONE PART..SO IF AFTER THIS VIDEO IS SHOWN.AND IPRA CONTINUES TO.INVESTIGATE AND THEY FIGURE OUT.PERHAPS IF THEY FIGURE OUT THAT.THAT INVESTIGATOR WHO WAS FIRED.WAS ACTUALLY IN THE RIGHT, THAT.HAS HUGE IMPLICATIONS..NOW WE CAN'T FORGET THAT ASIDE.FROM THIS, TWO OF CAPMAN'S.ACCOMPLICES WERE CHARGED WITH.MURDER IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE..EVEN THOUGH THE OFFICER WAS THE.ONE THAT FIRED THE SHOTS, THE.ACCOMPLICES WERE TEN BLOCKS AWAY.AND THEY WERE CHARGED WITH HIS.MURDER..AND THEY PLEADED DOWN TO A.LESSER CHARGE..SO YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE OTHER.BITS AND PIECES, PAMELA, TO THIS.PARTICULAR CASE THAT I THINK.THAT THE STAKES ARE A LOT HIGHER.BECAUSE OF THE IMPLICATIONS..IMPLICATIONS NOT ONLY LEGALLY.BUT ALSO POLITICALLY..>> ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF THE.LA-QUAN McDONALD
