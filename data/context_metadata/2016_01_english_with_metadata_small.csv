LOST LOVED ONES IN MASS.SHOOTINGS..CHRIS JANSING IS ON THE NORTH.LAWN..CHRIS, GIVE US DETAILS OF WHAT.THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT TO.ANNOUNCE..>> Reporter: THE BIGGEST THING.IS TO TRY TO EXPAND BACKGROUND.CHECKS..WE KNOW THAT IN STATES THAT HAVE.UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECK, GUN.DEATHS HAVE GONE OUT..HE WILL EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF.WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GUN DEALER.BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO.BE LICENSED IF YOU HAVE TO BE.LICENSED, THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO.DO A BACKGROUND CHECK..RIGHT NOW ABOUT 40% OF GUN SALES.DO NOT REQUIRE THAT..SO BY TOUGHENING UP THESE.REGULATIONS, THEY CAN HAVE MORE.PEOPLE CHECKED OUT BEFORE.THEY'RE ABLE TO GET A GUN..DO THAT, THEY WILL ALSO HAVE TO.ADD NEW FBI AGENTS..THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR MONEY.THERE CONGRESS TO MORE ATF.AGENTS, AS WELL..REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS AND ON.THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL HAVE BEEN.VERY MUCH AGAINST THIS, THEY SAY.THAT THIS IS THE PRESIDENT.TAKING MATTERS INTO HIS OWN.HANDS..CHRIS CHRISTIE CALLED HIM A.PETULANT CHILD..BUT TODAY, THIS IS THE PRESIDENT.MAKING HIS CASE TO THE AMERICAN.PEOPLE WHO LARGELY SUPPORT.BACKGROUND CHECKS IN GENERAL,.LESTER..>> ALL RIGHT..AND THE PRESIDENT ABOUT TO.SPEAK..HE'S BEING INTRODUCED BY NEWTOWN.FATHER WHO LOST HIS 7-YEAR-OLD.SON, DANIEL, IN THE MASSACRE AT.SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY IN 2012..AS I SAID, HE WILL INTRODUCE THE.PRESIDENT..LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT HE'S.SAYING..>> HERE WITH MY FAMILY AND VICE.PRESIDENT BIDEN, LISTENING TO.OUR PRESIDENT SPEAK, AND OUR.FEELINGS OF DESPAIR WERE.REPLACED WITH FEELINGS OF HOPE..AND I REMEMBER THINKING WHO WILL.HELP HIM WITH THIS?.IT'S A TALL ORDER..SO SINCE THEN, I'VE COME TO KNOW.AND RESPECT AND LEARN FROM MANY.AMAZING INDIVIDUALS AND.ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE DOING GOOD.SMART WORK IN THIS SPACE..AND MANY OF YOU ARE RIGHT HERE.RIGHT NOW..MANY FOLKS IN THE GUN VIOLENCE.PREVENTION COALITION HAVE HAD.NUMEROUS MEETINGS WITH VICE.PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRESIDENT.OBAMA AND THEIR TOP ADVISERS TO.ADDRESS THIS ISSUE..BUT WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE..AND THE PRESIDENT CAN'T DO IT.ALONE..THE THING IS, EVERY GUN-RELATED.DEATH IS PREVENTABLE..AND WE NEED YOUR HELP..WE NEED EVERYBODY ENGAGED IN.THIS..PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE A PROMISE.AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AND A.PROMISE AS A FATHER THAT HE.WOULD DO EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER.TO PROTECT OUR THAGS'S CHILDREN,.TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER.AND CURB THE LOSS OF LIFE TO GUN.VIOLENCE IN AMERICA..SO TODAY, WE CELEBRATE ANOTHER.EXAMPLE OF HOW PRESIDENT OBAMA.AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN.CONTINUE TO KEEP THAT PROMISE..IT IS WITH SUCH GREAT HONOR THAT.I INTRODUCE TO YOU THE PRESIDENT.OF THE UNITED STATES, BARACK.OBAMA, AND VICE PRESIDENT JOE.BIDEN..[ APPLAUSE ].>> THE PRESIDENT ENTERING THE.ROOM AFTER APPLAUSE..AGAIN, THERE ARE FAMILY MEMBERS.HERE WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES IN.MASS SHOOTINGS..MARK OF COURSE THE FATHER OF A.7-YEAR-OLD KILLED..DEBBIE GIFFORDS THERE ALSO..OF COURSE FIVE YEARS AGO SHE WAS.WOUNDED IN A MASS SHOOTING.DURING AN EVENT AT A SHOPPING.CENTER..>> THANK YOU..THANK YOU, EVERYBODY..THANK YOU..THANK YOU, EVERYBODY..PLEASE HAVE A SEAT..THANK YOU..THANK YOU, EVERYBODY..THANK YOU..THANK YOU, EVERYBODY..PLEASE, PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT..THANK YOU SO MUCH..MARK, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR.YOUR INTRODUCTION..I STILL REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME.WE MET, AND THE TIME WE SPENT.TOGETHER..AND THE CONVERSATION WE HAD.ABOUT DANIEL..AND THAT CHANGED ME THAT DAY..AND MY HOPE EARNESTLY HAS BEEN.THAT IT WOULD CHANGE THE.COUNTRY..FIVE YEARS AGO THIS WEEK, A.SITTING MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND.18 OTHERS WERE SHOT AT AT A.SUPERMARKET IN TUCSON, ARIZONA..IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME I HAD.HAD TO TALK TO THE NATION IN.RESPONSE TO A MASS SHOOTING,.NOR.WOULD IT BE THE LAST..FT. HOOD..BINGHAMTON..AURORA..OAK CREEK..NEWTOWN..THE NAVY YARD..SAN BERNARDINO..CHARLESTON..TOO MANY..>> TOO MANY..>> THANKS TO A GREAT MEDICAL.TEAM AND THE LOVE OF HER.HUSBAND, MARK, MY DEAR FRIEND.AND COLLEAGUE, GABBY GIFFORDS,.SURVIVED..SHE'S HERE WITH US TODAY WITH.HER WONDERFUL MOM..[ APPLAUSE ].>> THANKS TO A GREAT MEDICAL.TEAM, HER WONDERFUL HUSBAND,.MARK, WHO BY THE WAY THE LAST.TIME I MET WITH MARK, THIS THIS.IS JUST A SMALL ASIDE, YOU MAY.KNOW MARK'S TWIN BROTHER IS IN.OUTER SPACE..HE CAME TO THE OFFICE, AND I.SAID HOW OFTEN ARE YOU TALKING.TO HIM AND HE SAID I USUALLY.TALK TO HIM EVERY DAY, BUT THE.CALL WAS COMING IN RIGHT BEFORE.THE MEETING, SO I THINK I MAY.HAVE NOT ANSWERED HIS CALL..WHICH MADE ME FEEL KIND OF BAD..THAT'S A LONG DISTANCE CALL..SO I TOLD HIM IF HIS BROTHER.SCOTT IS CALLING TODAY, THAT HE.SHOULD TAKE IT..TURN THE RINGER ON..I WAS THERE WITH GABY WHEN SHE.WAS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL..AND WE DIDN'T THINK NECESSARILY.AT THAT POINT THAT SHE WAS GOING.TO SURVIVE..AND THAT VISIT RIGHT BEFORE.MEMORIAL, ABOUT AN HOUR LATER,.GABY FIRST OPENED HER EYES..BUT I KNOW THE PAIN THAT SHE AND.HER FAMILY HAVE ENDURED THESE.PAST FIVE YEARS..AND THE REHABILITATION AND THE.WORK AND THE EFFORT TO RECOVER.FROM SHATTERING INJURIES..AND THEN I THINK OF ALL THE.AMERICANS WHO AREN'T AS.FORTUNATE..EVERY SINGLE YEAR, MORE THAN.30,000 AMERICANS HAVE THEIR.LIVES CUT SHORT BY GUNS..30,000..SUICIDES, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE,.GANG SHOOT-OUTS, ACCIDENTS..HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF.AMERICANS HAVE LOST BROTHERS AND.SISTERS..OR BURIED THEIR OWN CHILDREN..MANY HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO LIVE.WITH A DISABILITY OR LEARN TO.LIVE WITHOUT THE LOVE OF THEIR.LIFE..A NUMBER OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE.HERE TODAY..THEY CAN TELL YOU SOME STORIES..IN THIS ROOM RIGHT HERE, THERE.ARE A LOT OF STORIES..THERE IS A LOT OF HEARTACHE..THERE A LOT OF RESILIENCE, A LOT.OF STRENGTH, BUT THERE IS ALSO A.LOT OF PAIN..AND THIS IS JUST A SMALL.SAMPLING..THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS.NOT THE ONLY COUNTRY ON EARTH.WITH VIOLENT OR DANGEROUS.PEOPLE..WE ARE NOT INHERENTLY MORE.REASON TO VIOLENCE..BUT WE ARE THE ONLY ADVANCED.COUNTRY ON EARTH THAT SEES THIS.KIND OF MASS VIOLENCE ERUPT WITH.THIS KIND OF FREQUENCY..IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN OTHER.ADVANCED COUNTRIES..IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE..AND AS I SAID BEFORE, SOMEHOW.WE'VE BECOME NUMB TO IT AND WE.START POSITIONING THAT THIS IS.NORMAL..AND INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT.HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM, THIS.HAS BECOME ONE OF OUR MOST.POLARIZED PARTISAN DEBATES..DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE IS A.GENERAL CONSENSUS IN AMERICA.ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE..THAT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY ON.THURSDAY I'M GOING TO HOLD A.TOWN HALL MEETING IN VIRGINIA ON.GUN VIOLENCE..BECAUSE MY GOAL HERE IS TO BRING.GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE.ISSUE TOGETHER FOR AN OPEN.DISCUSSION..I'M NOT ON THE BALLOT AGAIN..I'M NOT LOOKING TO SCORE SOME.POINTS..I THINK WE CAN DISAGREE WITHOUT.IMPUGNING OTHER PEOPLE'S MOTIVES.OR WITHOUT BEING DISAGREEABLE..WE DON'T NEED TO BE TALKING PAST.ONE ANOTHER..BUT WE DO HAVE TO FEEL A SENSE.OF URGENCY ABOUT IT..IN DR. KING'S WORD, WE HAVE TO.FEEL THE URGENCY OF NOW..BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DYING..AND THE CONSTANT EXCUSES FOR.INACTION NO LONGER DO..NO LONGER SUFFICE..THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY..NOT TO DEBATE THE LAST MASS.SHOOTING, BUT DO SOMETHING TO.TRY TO PREVENT THE NEXT ONE..[ APPLAUSE ].TO PROVE TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF.AMERICANS, EVEN IF OUR VOICES.AREN'T ALWAYS THE LOUDEST OR.MOST EXTREME, WE CARE ENOUGH.ABOUT A LITTLE BOY LIKE DANIEL.TO COME TOGETHER AND TAKE COMMON.SENSE STEPS TO SAVE LIVES AND.PROTECT MORE OF OUR CHILDREN..NOW, I WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY.CLEAR AT THE START..I'VE SAID THIS OVER AND OVER.AGAIN..THIS ALSO BECOMES ROUTINE..THERE IS A RITUAL ABOUT THIS.WHOLE THING THAT I HAVE TO DO..I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND.AMENDMENT..IT'S THERE WRITTEN ON THE PAPER..IT GUARANTEES A RIGHT TO BEAR.ARMS..NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES PEOPLE.TRY TO TWIST MY WORDS AROUND, I.TAUGHT CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, I.KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS..I GET IT..BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN.FIND WAYS TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE.CONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND.AMENDMENT..I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT..WE ALL BELIEVE IN THE FIRST.AMENDMENT, THE GUARANTEE OF FREE.SPEECH..BUT WE ACCEPT THAT YOU CAN'T.YELL ""FIRE"" IN A THEATER..WE UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME.CONSTRAINTS ON OUR FREEDOM IN.ORDER TO PROTECT INNOCENT.PEOPLE..WE CHERISH OUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY,.BUT WE ACCEPT THAT YOU HAVE TO.GO THROUGH METAL DETECTORS.BEFORE BEING ALLOWED TO BOARD A.PLANE..IT'S NOT BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE.DOING THAT..BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS.PART OF THE PRICE OF LIVING IN A.CIVILIZED SOCIETY..AND WHAT IS OFTEN IGNORED IN.THIS DEBATE IS THAT A MAJORITY.OF GUN OWNERS ACTUALLY AGREE..A MAJORITY OF GUN OWNERS AGREE.THAT WE CAN RESPECT THE SECOND.AMENDMENT WHILE KEEPING AN.IRRESPONSIBLE LAW-BREAKING FEW.FROM INFLICTING HARM ON A.MASSIVE SCALE..TODAY BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE.REQUIRED AT GUN STORES..IF A FATHER WANTS TO TEACH HIS.DAUGHTER HOW TO HUNT, HE CAN.WALK INTO A GUN STORE, GET A.BACKGROUND CHECK, PURCHASE HIS.WEAPON SAFELY AND RESPONSIBLY..THIS IS NOT SEEN AS AN.INFRINGEMENT ON THE SECOND.AMENDMENT..CONTRARY TO THE CLAIMS OF WHAT.SOME GUN RIGHTS PROPONENTS HAVE.SUGGESTED, THIS HASN'T BEEN THE.FIRST STEP IN SOME SLIPPERY.SLOPE TO MASS CONFISCATION..CONTRARY TO CLAIMS OF SOME.PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES.APPARENTLY BEFORE THIS MEETING,.THIS IS NOT A PLOT TO TAKE AWAY.EVERYBODY'S GUNS..YOU PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK, YOU.PURCHASE A FIREARM..THE PROBLEM IS SOME GUN SELLERS.HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER A.DIFFERENT SET OF RULES..A VIOLENT FELON CAN BUY THE.EXACT SAME WEAPON OVER THE.INTERNET WITH NO BACKGROUND.CHECK, NO QUESTIONS ASKED..A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT ABOUT.1 IN 30 PEOPLE LOOKING TO BUY.GUNS ON ONE WEBSITE HAD CRIMINAL.RECORDS..1 OUT OF 30 HAD A CRIMINAL.RECORD..WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS.CONVICTED OF SERIOUS CRIME,.AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, DOMESTIC.VIOLENCE, ROBBERY, ILLEGAL GUN.POSSESSION..PEOPLE WITH LENGTHY CRIMINAL.HISTORIES BUYING DEADLY WEAPONS.ALL TOO EASILY..AND THIS WAS JUST ONE WEBSITE.WITHIN THE SPAN OF A FEW MONTHS..SO WE'VE CREATED A SYSTEM IN.WHICH DANGEROUS PEOPLE ARE.ALLOWED TO PLAY BY A DIFFERENT.SET OF RULES THAN A RESPONSIBLE.GUN OWNER WHO BUYS HIS OR HER.GUN THE RIGHT WAY AND SUBJECTS.THEMSELVES TO A BACKGROUND.CHECK..IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE..EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE TO ABIDE.BY THE SAME RULES..MOST AMERICANS AND GUN OWNERS.AGREE..AND THAT IS WHAT WE TRIED TO.CHANGE THREE YEARS AGO AFTER 26.AMERICANS, INCLUDING 20.CHILDREN, WERE MURDERED AT SANDY.HOOK ELEMENTARY..TWO UNITED STATES SENATOR, JOE.MANCHIN, A DEMOCRAT FROM WEST.VIRGINIA, AND PAT TOOMEY, A.REPUBLICAN FROM PENNSYLVANIA,.BOTH GUN OWNER, STRONG DEFENDERS.OF OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS,.BOTH WITH A-GRADES FROM THE N.RA, THAT'S HARD TO GET, WORK.TOGETHER IN GOOD FAITH AND.CONSULTING WITH FOLKS LIKE OUR.VICE PRESIDENT, WHO HAS BEEN A.CHAMPION ON THIS FOR A LONG.TIME, TO WRITE A COMMON SENSE.COMPROMISE BILL THAT WOULD HAVE.REQUIRED VIRTUALLY EVERYONE WHO.BUYS A GUN TO GET A BACKGROUND.CHECK..THAT WAS IT..PRETTY COMMON SENSE STUFF..90% OF AMERICANS SUPPORTED THAT.IDEA..90% OF DEMOCRATS IN THE IS THAT.THE SENATE VOTED FOR THAT IDEA..BUT IT FAILED..BECAUSE 90% OF REPUBLICANS IN.THE SENATE VOTED AGAINST THAT.IDEA..HOW DID THIS BECOME SUCH A.PARTISAN ISSUE?.REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT GEORGE W..BUSH ONCE SAID I BELIEVE IN.BACKGROUND CHECKS AT GUN SHOWS.OR ANYWHERE TO MAKE SURE GUNS.DON'T GET INTO THE HANDS OF.PEOPLE THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM..SENATOR JOHN McCAIN INTRODUCED A.BIPARTISAN MEASURE TO ADDRESS.THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE SAYING WE.NEED THIS AMENDMENT BECAUSE.CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS HAVE.EXPLOITED AND ARE EXPLOITING.THIS VERY OBVIOUS LOOPHOLE IN.OUR GUN SAFETY LAWS..EVEN THE NRA USED TO SUPPORT.EXPANDED BACKGROUND CHECKS..AND BY THE WAY MOST OF ITS.MEMBERS STILL DO..MOST REPUBLICAN VOTERS STILL DO..HOW DID WE GET HERE?.HOW IT WE DID WE GET TO THE.PLACE WHERE REQUIRING A.COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK.MEANS TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S GUNS?.EACH TIME THIS COMES UP, WE ARE.FED THE EXCUSE THAT COMMON SENSE.REFORMS LIKE BACKGROUND CHECKSB.AWAY PEOPLE'S GUNS?.EACH TIME THIS COMES UP, WE ARE.FED THE EXCUSE THAT COMMON SENSE.REFORMS LIKE BACKGROUND CHECKS.MIGHT NOT HAVE STOPPED THE LAST.MASSACRE..OR THE ONE BEFORE THAT..OR THE ONE BEFORE THAT..SO WHY BOTHER TRYING..I REJECT THAT THINKING..[ APPLAUSE ].WE KNOW WE CAN'T STOP EVERY ACT.OF EVIL IN THE WORLD, BUT MAYBE.WE COULD TRY TO STOP ONE ACT OF.EVIL, ONE AGENT OF VIOLENCE..SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL THAT AT.THE SAME TIME THAT SANDY HOOK.HAPPENED, A DISTURBED PERSON IN.CHINA TOOK A KNIFE AND TRIED TO.KILL WITH A KNIFE A

It is not recommended as.      the first medication.      to treat diabetes....  ...and should not be used in.  people with type 1 diabetes.   or diabetic ketoacidosis..

Do not take INVOKANA®.           if you have.    severe kidney problems or.         are on dialysis..Stop taking and call your doctor.        right away if you.       experience symptoms.     such as rash, swelling,.     or difficulty breathing.          or swallowing..

RELEASERELEASED..ROSA FLORES IS FOLLOWING THIS.STORY FROM CHICAGO..YOU HAVE SEEN THE VIDEO..TELL US ABOUT IT, ROSA..>> PAMELA, IT COMES DOWN TO TEN.SECONDS OF VIDEO..LET ME STTAKE YOU THROUGH THIS..WHAT YOU SEE INITIALLY IS.CEDRICK CHAPMAN GETTING OUT OF.HIS VEHICLE AND START A SPRINT.AWAY FROM POLICE..YOU CAN SEE THAT HE SQUEEZES.BETWEEN TWO CARS AND THERE'S A.POLICE OFFICER TRAILING RIGHT.BEHIND HIM..HE'S JUST A FEW FEET AWAY FROM.C.CHAPMAN..>> WE'RE SHOWING IT NOW..>> THEN YOU SEE THE OTHER POLICE.OFFICER..THE SHOOTING POLICE OFFICER.ACTUALLY AIMING AT CHAPMAN..THIS HAPPENS VERY QUICKLY IN.ABOUT TEN SECONDS..THEN AFTER THAT ALL YOU SEE ONCE.THE ANGLE OF THAT CAMERA.CHANGES, YOU SEE CHAPMAN ON THE.GROUND..BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, WE HEARD.THIS STORY BEFORE THE.DESCRIPTION OF THE VIDEO..THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT.WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING THIS.VIDEO..I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU ONE OF.THE -- PROBABLY THE MOST.DISTURBING PART IS TOWARDS THE.END....IF YOU KEEP PLAYING THIS, YOU.SEE THE POLICE OFFICER PLACE HIS.FOOT ON TOP OF THE BODY..NOW FROM TALKING TO AN.INVESTIGATOR WHO WAS ACTUALLY.FIRED AFTER HE DECIDED THAT THIS.WAS NOT A JUSTIFIED SHOOTING, HE.TELLS US HAD THAT WHAT HAPPENED.AFTER IS THE OFFICER HANDCUFFED.CHAPMAN AND THEN WHAT YOU SEE IN.THAT VIDEO IS THIS POLICE.OFFICER PLACES HIS FOOT ON TOP.OF HIS BODY..>> SO WALK US THROUGH THIS.AGAIN..WE JUST SAW SOME CLIPS

STARTS RUNNING AWAY FROM.POLICE OFFICERS..YOU SEE HIM KIND OF SQUEEZE IN.BETWEEN TWO VEHICLES AND THERE'S.A POLICE OFFICER RIGHT BEHIND.HIM..THAT POLICE OFFICER IS STILL.FOLLOWING HIM AS CHAPMAN.CONTINUES RUNNING ON THE.SIDEWALK..HE'S GOING TO TURN THE CORNER.THERE..A PART OF THIS WE DON'T QUITE.SEE BECAUSE THE FRAMING OF THAT.SHOT CHANGES..BUT YOU DO SEE THE SHOOTING.POLICE OFFICER AND HE IS WITH.HIS GUN DRAWN FOLLOWING CHAPMAN..THEN YOU SEE THAT OFFICER AT THE.INTERSECTION AND THEN ONCE THE.ANGLE OF THAT CAMERA CHANGING,.YOU DO SEE CHAPMAN ON THE GROUND.AND THE OTHER POLICE OFFICER.WITH HIS FOOT ON TOP OF HIS.BODY..NOW WE GOT TO TELL THE OFFICER'S.SIDE OF THE STORY..THE OFFICERS HAVE SAID THEY.FEARED FOR THEIR LIVES..THEY FELT THAT CHAPMAN TURNED.AROUND AND THAT THEY WERE IN.FEAR FOR THEIR LIFE AND HAD A.BLACK OBJECT..THE OBJECT WAS AN iPHONE BOX AND.THERE WAS NO WEAPON EVER.RECOVERED ON THE SCENE OTHER.THAN THAT iPHONE BOX THAT.CHAPMAN WAS HOLDING AND THAT WAS.RECOVERED LATER ON THE SCENE..>> I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS.WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY.CHARLES COLEMAN JR., TRIAL.ATTORNEY..THE FAMILY OF CEDRICK CHAPMAN.PUSH ED FOR THIS VUD OWE TO BE.RELEASED AS PART OF A WRONGFUL.DEATH LAWSUIT..THE CITY OPPOSED IT WHILE COURT.HEARINGS WERE UNDERWAY AND THEN.DID AN ABOUT FACE AND WANTED IT.TO BE RELEASED AS OF LAST NIGHT..WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?.WAS THAT THE RIGHT THING TO.RELEASE IT?.>> I DO THINK IT WAS THE RIGHT.THING TO RELEASE THE TAPE....HOWEVER, THE CITY'S MANEUVERING.STRIKES ME AS BEING A LOT OF PR.SPIN..WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO OR.WHAT IS SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE.TRYING TO DO IS IN LIEU OF ALL.THE POLICE SHOOTINGS WE HAVE.SEEN, WE SEE McDONALD, RONALD.JOHNSON AND NOW THIS CEDRICK.CHAMPIONSHIPMAN SHOOTING....WITH ALL THESE THINGS THAT HAVE.HAPPENED, HIS OFFICE HAS TAKEN A.TERRIBLE HIT WITH RESPECT TO.POLICE CORRUPTION AND ABUSE OF.FORCE IN CHICAGO..SO WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO.NOW IS SUGGEST WE WANT TO BE.TRANSPARENT AND OPEN WITH THE.COMMUNITY, BUT IT REALLY SORT OF.SEEMS LIKE WHAT HE'S TRYING TO.DO IS SAVE FACE WITH THE.CITIZENS OF CHICAGO..>> WERE YOU ABLE TO WATCH THE.VIDEO THAT WE JUST SHOWED?.>> I DID..I SAW IT AS ONE OF THE THINGS.THAT SOME OF THE LAWYERS FOR THE.CITY WAS ARGUING IS THE VIDEO.WASN'T CLEAR AND WOULDN'T BE.ABLE TO MAKE OUT WHAT ACTUALLY.HAPPENED..IN HIS ORDER THE JUDGE WAS VERY.CLEAR..THE JUDGE WAS IRRITATED THAT THE.CITY SORT OF DID THIS ABOUT.FACE..IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE JUDGE.WAS ALSO CLEAR THAT WHILE THE.VIDEO MAY NOT BE CLEAR, YOU CAN.SEE MORE THAN WHAT THE LAWYERS.FROM THE CITY OF CHICAGO WERE.TRYING TO SUGGEST WOULD BE ABLE.TO BE SEEN ON THE VIDEO..>> AND THE FEDERAL JUDGE IN HAD.THIS CASE THAT YOU JUST TALKED.ABOUT HE DID NOT MINCE WORDS.CALLING THE ACTION IRRESPONSIBLE.IN THIS CASE IN A WASTE OF.TAXPAYER'S MONEY AND THE COURT'S.TIME..DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?.>> I THINK THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT.IT IN TERMS OF WHAT IT IS.JUDICIALLY IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH.THIS COST THE CITY, HOW MUCH.TIME AND RESOURCES HAVE GONE.INTO NOT ONLY PAYING FOR THE.LAWYERS OR FIGHTING THIS CASE IN.COURT, BUT ALSO JUST THE LAW.THAT IT CREATES IN THE JUSTICE.SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE JUDGE.LOOKING AT THE CASE..IT'S SOMETHING THEY SHOULD BE.REPRIMANDED ABOUT BECAUSE IF IT.WAS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY, IF IT.WAS ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND.CHICAGO KNOWING WHAT ACTUALLY.HAPPENED, THEY COULD HAVE.RELEASED ANY SORT OF FIGHT AND.STOPPED THAT EARLY ON..INSTEAD THEY WAIT UNTIL THE 11th.HOUR AND DECIDE AT THAT POINT.THEY ARE GOING TO BE OKAY WITH.THE VIDEO BEING RELEASED..I DO UNDERSTAND THE JUDGE'S.FRUSTRATIONS AND I'M INCLINED TO.AGREE..IF THIS WAS THE POSITION FROM.THE VERY BEGINNING, FROM THE.OUTSET THEN THAT SHOULD HAVE.BEEN THEY WERE ARGUING..>> QUICKLY BEFORE..I GO BACK TO ROSA, DO YOU THINK.THE OFFICERS HAVE A CASE HERE?.THEY SAY THAT WE WERE RUNNING.AFTER THIS GUY..HE JUST STOLE A CAR..WE BELIEVED HE HAD A GUN AND WE.FELT THREATENED FOR OUR LIVES..>> AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, I.HAVE SEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT.THINGS..WHEN I LOOK AT THIS VIDEO AND.HEAR THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT IS.BEING SAID, IT'S DIFFICULT R FOR.ME TO TO BELIEVE THAT THESE.OFFICERS CAN ARTICULATE THEY.WERE IN FEAR OF THEIR LIVES..AS THIS 17-YEAR-OLD UNARMED.YOUNG BLACK MAN IS RUNNING AWAY.FROM THEM, HE'S SHOT IN THE BACK.BY POLICE WHO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY.TO TAKE AIM AT HIM AND FIRE..I HAVE A REALLY HARD TIME.BELIEVING THAT..I THINK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT.IT IN TERMS OF THE LAW, THEY.HAVE TROUBLE ARTICULATING WHAT.THEY SAW AS A PERCEIVED THREAT.TO THEIR LIFE THAT WOULD CAUSE.THEM TO UNHOLSTER THEIR FIREARM.AND THEN DISCHARGE THEIR FIREARM.TO AN UNARMED YOUNG MAN..WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE.THOUGHT HE HAD A BLACK OBJECT IN.HIS HAND..THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS..IT WAS AN iPHONE BOX..I DON'T NECESSARILY BELIEVE.THESE OFFICERS HAVE MUCH TO.STAND ON IN TERMS OF THE.SHOOTING..I AGREE WITH THE OFFICER IN.CHICAGO WHO SUGGESTED THAT THEY.TURN THE RULING ON THIS AROUND..THIS SHOOTING WAS CLEARLY.UNJUSTIFIED..>> AND I WANT TO BRING ROSA BACK.IN TO GET THE REACTION IN.CHICAGO AND ALSO LEARN MORE.ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS..>> I THINK THE IMPLICATIONS ARE.VERY HIGH BECAUSE IN THIS.PARTICULAR CASE, NOT ONLY ARE WE.TALKING ABOUT AN.OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING LIKE.WE HAVE SEEN IN OTHER CASES, BUT.IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE YOU'VE.GOT AN INVESTIGATOR THAT.INVESTIGATES EVERY.OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING, YOU.HAVE AN INVESTIGATOR WHO WAS.FIRED BECAUSE HE SAYS THAT HAD.HE WAS GOING TO DEEM THIS.PARTICULAR SHOOTING UNJUSTIFIED..HE WAS ASKED TO CHANGE IT TO.JUSTIFIED..NOW THAT ORGANIZATION, THE HEAD.OF THAT ORGANIZATION IS.APPOINTED BY THE MAYOR OF.CHICAGO..NOW AFTER THE LA-QUAN McDONALD.AND THE RELEASE OF THAT VIDEO.SHS THE HEAD OF THAT.ORGANIZATION RESIGNED..THE MAYOR ASKED HIM TO STEP.DOWN..THAT'S ONE PART..SO IF AFTER THIS VIDEO IS SHOWN.AND IPRA CONTINUES TO.INVESTIGATE AND THEY FIGURE OUT.PERHAPS IF THEY FIGURE OUT THAT.THAT INVESTIGATOR WHO WAS FIRED.WAS ACTUALLY IN THE RIGHT, THAT.HAS HUGE IMPLICATIONS..NOW WE CAN'T FORGET THAT ASIDE.FROM THIS, TWO OF CAPMAN'S.ACCOMPLICES WERE CHARGED WITH.MURDER IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE..EVEN THOUGH THE OFFICER WAS THE.ONE THAT FIRED THE SHOTS, THE.ACCOMPLICES WERE TEN BLOCKS AWAY.AND THEY WERE CHARGED WITH HIS.MURDER..AND THEY PLEADED DOWN TO A.LESSER CHARGE..SO YOU HAVE ALL OF THESE OTHER.BITS AND PIECES, PAMELA, TO THIS.PARTICULAR CASE THAT I THINK.THAT THE STAKES ARE A LOT HIGHER.BECAUSE OF THE IMPLICATIONS..IMPLICATIONS NOT ONLY LEGALLY.BUT ALSO POLITICALLY..>> ESPECIALLY IN THE WAKE OF THE.LA-QUAN McDONALD

FIRST.RESPONSE TO A STATE OF THE UNION.GIVEN BY PRESIDENT OBAMA..THE FIRST STATE OF THE UNION, OR.JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS, AT.THE TIME OF THE STATE OF THE.UNION..AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS FIRST.ELECTED..THE RESPONSE FROM THE.REPUBLICANS THAT YEAR WAS BOBBY.JINDAL..IT WAS A MEMORABLE STATE OF THE.UNION RESPONSE FOR GOVERNOR.JINDAL BUT NOT NECESSARILY IN A.GOOD WAY..REMEMBER THE VOLCANO THING?.INCIDENTALLY, FORMER GOVERNOR.BOBBY JINDAL IS NOW UNEMPLOYED..HE HAS TERMED OUT OF HIS TIME AS.LOUISIANA GOVERNOR AND BEEN.REPLACED IN THAT JOB, AND HE HAS.DROPPED OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN.RACE FOR PRESIDENT THIS YEAR..SO NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S.DOING..THE YEAR AFTER BOBBY JINDAL THE.REPUBLICAN PARTY PICKED BOB.McCONNELL TO RESPOND TO.PRESIDENT OBAMA'S STATE OF THE.UNION..GOVERNOR McDONNELL HAS STILL.BEEN -- HAS SINCE BEEN CONVICTED.ON MULTIPLE FELONY CORRUPTION.CHARGES AND SENTENCED TO YEARS.IN FEDERAL PRISON..HE'S CURRENTLY AWAITING A UNITED.STATES SUPREME COURT REVIEW OF.HIS CONVICTION..AFTER THAT START THE FOLLOWING.YEAR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.STARTED DOING SOMETHING NEW.AROUND THE STATE OF THE UNION.INSTEAD OF JUST HAVING AN.OFFICIAL RESPONSE BY THE.REPUBLICAN PARTY THEY STARTED.DOING AN OFFICIAL RESPONSE PLUS.SOME OTHER PSEUDO-OFFICIAL.RESPONSE..THAT THIRD YEAR OF THE OBAMA.PRESIDENCY IT WAS PAUL RYAN, NOW.SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE..HE GAVE THE OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN.RESPONSE BUP WHAT MOST PEOPLE.REMEMBER FROM THAT YEAR WAS THAT.WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT IN.ADDITION TO THE OFFICIAL.REPUBLICAN RESPONSE THERE WAS.ALSO AN OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN TEA.PARTY RESPONSE..AND THE TEA PARTY ONE THAT FIRST.YEAR WAS GIVEN BY MICHELE.BACHMANN..ALTHOUGH SHE WAS MOSTLY LOOKING.OFF INTO MIDDLE DISTANCE BECAUSE.APPARENTLY THEY DID NOT LINE UP.THE TELEPROMPTER WITH THE.CAMERA..THAT WAS SAD..THE FOLLOWING YEAR AT THE STATE.OF THE UNION IT WAS THE GOVERNOR.OF INDIANA WHO GAVE THE OFFICIAL.REPUBLICAN RESPONSE..HIS NAME IS MITCH DANIELS..HE'S OUT OF POLITICS NOW..BUT THE OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN TEA.PARTY RESPONSE THAT YEAR WAS BY.HERMAN CAIN..MR. 999..THE YEAR AFTER, THAT 2013, THE.OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN REPUBLICAN.RESPONSE WAS A VERY THIRSTY.MARCO RUBIO..THE OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN TEA.PARTY RESPONSE THAT YEAR WAS.RAND PAUL..AND RAND PAUL APPARENTLY LIKED.DOING THAT SO MUCH THAT THE NEXT.YEAR IN 2014, ALTHOUGH HE WASN'T.PICKED TO GIVE EITHER THE.OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN REPUBLICAN.RESPONSE AND HE WAS NOT PICKED.TO GIFT OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN TEA.PARTY RESPONSE, THAT WAS DONE BY.SENATOR MIKE LEIGH THE FOLLOWING.YEAR, INSTEAD IN 2014 RAND PAUL.DECIDED THAT HE WOULD DO HIS OWN.OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN RAND PAUL.RESPONSE..SO THAT YEAR, 2014, STATE OF THE.UNION RESPONSE BY THE REPUBLICAN.PARTY..ANOTHER ONE BY THE TEA PARTY.REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND ANOTHER.ONE, A THIRD ONE BY REPUBLICAN.RAND PAUL..SO BY 2014 THERE WERE THREE.REPUBLICAN RESPONSES TO THE.STATE OF THE UNION..EVEN THOUGH THE STATE OF THE.UNION ITSELF HAS NOT CHANGED.VERY MUCH, THE WAY THE.REPUBLICAN PARTY RESPONDS TO IT.HAS GROWN WEIRDER AND MORE.FRACTURED OVER A VERY SHORT.PERIOD OF TIME TO THE POINT.WHERE THIS YEAR I THINK THEY.KIND OF JUST WENT OFF THE CLIFF.INTO RAW UNFILTERED OBSCURITY..THE OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN RESPONSE.TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S STATE OF.THE UNION SPEECH THIS YEAR WAS.BY REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR NIKKI.HALEY OF SOUTH CAROLINA..MOSTLY MEMORABLE BECAUSE.GOVERNOR HALEY USED THAT.OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN PARTY.PLATFORM TO TAKE A TOTALLY.UNVEILED SHOT AT THE REPUBLICAN.PARTY'S PRESIDENTIAL.FRONT-RUNNER, DONALD TRUMP..SHE ESSENTIALLY CAUTIONED THE.COUNTRY AGAINST VOTING FOR.DONALD TRUMP..AND IT WAS AN OFFICIAL.REPUBLICAN PARTY SPEECH..WE LATER LEARNED THAT HER SPEECH.HAD BEEN CLEARED WITH NOT ONLY.THE PARTY ITSELF BUT ALSO WITH.THE TOP REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE.AND THE TOP REPUBLICAN IN THE.SENATE..SO IT WAS KIND OF AMAZING IN A.WAY, RIGHT?.THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THAT.OFFICIAL SETTING, THAT FORMAL.AND APPROVED AND SIGNED-OFF-ON.OFFICIAL SETTING SAYING DON'T.VOTE FOR OUR PRESIDENTIAL.FRONT-RUNNER, RESIST THE APPEAL.OF VOICES LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S..WELL, IN ADDITION TO THAT, IN.ADDITION TO THE NIKKI HALEY.SPEECH, WHICH WAS CONTROVERSIAL.FOR EXACTLY THE REASONS THEY.KNEW IT WOULD BE CONTROVERSIAL,.IN ADDITION TO THAT IT DIDN'T.GET AS MUCH ATTENTION AS IT DID.IN YEARS PAST, BUT THIS YEAR.THERE WAS ALSO A REPUBLICAN TEA.PARTY RESPONSE TO THE STATE OF.THE UNION..THERE WAS NIKKI HALEY'S ADDRESS.FOR THE REPUBLICAN REPUBLICAN.ONE..BUT THE TEA PARTY REPUBLICAN ONE.WAS GIVEN BY A GUY YOU'VE NEVER.HEARD OF..HIS NAME IS WAYNE ALAN ROOT..HUH?.WAYNE ALAN ROOT..I HAD TO CHECK TWICE TO MAKE.SURE THAT'S THE ORDER OF THE.WORDS..BUT THAT IS..WAYNE ALAN ROOT..IF YOU WANT A SENSE OF THE.SCHISM IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.RIGHT NOW, THE DIVIDE RIGHT DOWN.THE MIDDLE OF THAT PARTY, THIS.IS A VERY CLEAR WAY TO SHOW THAT.BECAUSE THE OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN.REPUBLICAN RESPONSE TO THE STATE.OF THE UNION WAS NIKKI HALEY.SAYING DON'T VOTE FOR DONALD.TRUMP..THE OFFICIAL REPUBLICAN TEA.PARTY RESPONSE TO THE STATE OF.THE UNION WAS GIVEN BY THIS GUY.WAYNE ALAN ROOT, WHO TODAY.DEBUTED AS A WARM-UP ACT AND.EMCEE FOR DONALD TRUMP CAMPAIGN.RALLIES..>> I'M SUPPORTING DONALD J..TRUMP BECAUSE DONALD UNDERSTANDS.THIS ISN'T A PICNIC, THIS ISN'T.A GOLF MATCH WITH MUFFY AT THE.COUNTRY CLUB, THIS ISN'T.BADMINTON, THIS IS A WAR..YOU AND I LOVE TRUMP BECAUSE WE.KNOW HE'LL GO TO WASHINGTON AND.BREAK IT..HE'LL UPSET THE APPLE CART..HE'LL DERAIL THE GRAVY TRAIN..HE'LL BE A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP..WE KNOW HE WILL INVESTIGATE AND.PROSECUTE THE THIEVES AND FRAUDS.WHO HAVE RIPPED OFF YOU, THE.AMERICAN TAXPAYERS..HE WILL ROOT OUT THE INCOMPETENT.BIGSHOT BUREAUCRATS AND BRING.THEM INTO THE BOARDROOM AND.HE'LL SAY, ""YOU'RE FIRED!"".AND YOU AND I KNOW HE'LL DO THAT.ON DAY ONE..CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT DONALD.TRUMP WILL DO ON DAY TWO?.>> WAYNE ALLYN ROOT..I THINK HE IS A SELF-HELP AUTHOR.OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT..HE GAVE THE TEA PARTY REPUBLICAN.RESPONSE TO THE STATE OF THE.UNION THIS YEAR..HE IS NOW THE OPENING ACT FOR.DONALD TRUMP AT HIS CAMPAIGN.RALLIES..THIS WAS HIM IN VEGAS TODAY TALK.ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD DO.ON DAY ONE OF THE DONALD TRUMP.PRESIDENCY..NOW, INCIDENTALLY, JUST AS AN.ASIDE, IF DONALD TRUMP DOES GET.THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AND HE.DOES WIN THE ELECTION, HE GETS.ELECTED PRESIDENT, SO IF THERE.IS GOING TO BE A DAY ONE OF THE.DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY, IT.WOULD BE EXACTLY ONE YEAR FROM.TODAY..WHOEVER THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS.GOING TO BE, DONALD TRUMP OR.ANYBODY ELSE, THIS TIME NEXT.YEAR WILL BE -- THIS WILL BE THE.END OF THEIR FIRST FULL DAY IN.OFFICE..I'M READY FOR YOU GUYS..IF YOU'RE TRYING TO WRAP YOUR.HEAD AROUND THE KINDS OF FORCES.THAT ARE MARSHALING TO SUPPORT.FRONT-RUNNER DONALD TRUMP IN HIS.PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, I FEEL I.SHOULD ALSO DIRECT YOU RIGHT NOW.TO WAYNE ALLYN ROOT'S LATEST.OP-ED, WHICH HE PUBLISHED ON THE.GLENN BECK WEBSITE TODAY..THE TITLE OF THE OP-ED IS ""GET.READY FOR PRESIDENT DONALD.TRUMP."".HERE'S THE LEAD..THIS IS SO GREAT..THIS IS HOW IT STARTS..""THE STOCK MARKET IS CRASHING..THE ECONOMY IS IN REVERSE..SARAH PALIN IS BACK IN THE.HEADLINES..AND HILLARY CLINTON IS IN.FREEFALL..ALL THE DUCKS ARE FALLING IN.PLACE FOR DONALD TRUMP."".THOSE POOR DUCKS..ALL THE DUCKS ARE FALLING --.SEE, IT'S SLIPPERY OUT THERE..THE DUCKS DO NOT HAVE GOOD.FOOTWEAR FOR ICY CONDITIONS..EVEN WHEN THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO.MOVE, THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO.STAND IN PLACE..BUT THE DUCKS ARE FALLING..THE DUCKS ARE FALLING IN PLACE..POOR DUCKS..AND WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT.OF STANDING STILL BUT STILL.FINDING A WAY TO FALL DOWN,.LET'S ALSO SPARE A THOUGHT FOR.POOR JEB BUSH..BECAUSE IN THE NIGHTMARE THAT IS.JEB BUSH'S FLAILING PRESIDENTIAL.CAMPAIGN IT HAS NOW HAPPENED TO.HIM AGAIN TODAY..ONE OF THE FASCINATE THINGS.ABOUT THE JEB BUSH FOR PRESIDENT.CAMPAIGN THIS YEAR..AND IT'S DIFFERENT THAN.EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE RACE..IT'S A JEB-SPECIFIC THING, BUT.IT KEEPS HAPPENING..IT'S THE WAY HIS SUPPORTERS AND.PARTICULARLY HIS DONORS HAVE.BEEN WILLING TO TALK INCREDIBLE.SMACK ABOUT HIM AND HIS CAMPAIGN.TO REPORTERS..THIS KEEPS HAPPENING OVER AND.OVER AND OVER AGAIN OVER THE.COURSE OF THIS PAST YEAR SINCE.HE GOT INTO THE RACE..THERE HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY.DIRECT QUOTES FROM JEB BUSH.SUPPORTERS AND DONORS TALKING TO.THE PRESS ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE AND.DISAPPOINTING JEB BUSH AND HIS.CAMPAIGN ARE..AND THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OF.THIS PITIFUL LITTLE SOAP OPERA.IS PUBLISHED AT POLITICO.COM.TODAY..LOOK AT HEADLINE..""THE BUSH BLAME GAME BEGINS."".NOBODY'S VOTED YET..BUT THAT'S THE HEADLINE..""THE BUSH BLAME GAME BEGINS."".ONE DONOR'S QUOTED BASICALLY.BEGGING FOR JEB BUSH TO DROP OUT.OF THE RACE, I THINK..TO STOP THE BLEEDING OR.SOMETHING..THE QUOTE IS THIS..""IT'S PAINFUL BECAUSE WE'RE.WATCHING SOMETHING HAPPEN THAT.NO ONE ENVISIONED HAPPENING..WE ALL WANTED IT TO BE JEB, BUT.IF IT CAN'T BE JEB, AT SOME.POINT DOESN'T REALITY HAVE TO.SET IN?"".THE FOCUS OF THIS LATEST HIT.PIECE BY HIS OWN DONORS IS HOW.DISGUSTED JEB BUSH DONORS ARE.NOT ONLY WITH HIS PERFORMANCE AS.A CANDIDATE BUT SPECIFICALLY.WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS.SUPER PAC, WHICH OF COURSE HAS.RAISED MORE THAN $100 MILLION ON.HIS BEHALF AND WHICH SO FAR HAS.SPENT ALMOST 60 MILLION OF THOSE.DOLLARS TO TRY TO ELECT HIM OR.AT LEAST TO IMPROVE HIS IMAGE..AND SOME OF THE CRITICISM OF THE.JEB SUPER PAC IS A LITTLE.ANODYNE, BASICALLY DESCRIPTIVE..""MULTIPLE ADVISERS TO THE RIGHT.TO RISE SUPER PAC CONCEDE.PRIVATELY THAT THE $40 MILLION.SPENT ON POSITIVE ADS AIMED AT.TELLING BUSH'S STORY SO FAR HAVE.YIELDED NO TANGIBLE DIVIDENDS."".SOME OF IT IS JUST LIKE WE'RE.UNHAPPY KINDS OF QUOTES AND.DESCRIPTIONS LIKE THAT..BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO THE FAIRLY.LURID STUFF..APPARENTLY, A FEW WEEKS AGO THE.JEB BUSH SUPER PAC PUT UP THESE.BILLBOARDS IN A FEW EARLY VOTING.STATES..THEY ARE VERY, VERY SIMPLE..NO BACKGROUND..NO PICTURE..STANDARD FONT..THE ONLY DETAIL THERE IS THAT.LITTLE SMALL PRINT THING YOU.THAT SEE IN THE RECTANGLE AT THE.BOTTOM..THAT'S JUST LIKE THE LEGALLY.REQUIRED TAG THAT SAYS WHO'S.PAYING FOR IT..THAT'S IT..THE ONLY OTHER THING, THE ONLY.THING IT SAYS ON THE BILLBOARD.IS THIS QUOTE THAT IS ATTRIBUTED.TO JEB BUSH..AND THE QUOTE IS ""DONALD TRUMP.IS UNHINGED."".BY JEB BUSH..NOW, ONE THING YOU WOULD EXPECT.FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THIS.DAY AND AGE IS THAT PEOPLE WOULD.START PHOTOSHOPPING THAT BECAUSE.IT'S REALLY EASY TO PHOTOSHOP.SOMETHING THAT HAS NO PICTURES,.NO BACKGROUND, IT'S JUST PLAIN.WHITE TEXT ON A COLORED.BACKGROUND..YOU'RE BASICALLY BEGGING FOR.PEOPLE TO PHOTOSHOP IT..THAT'S WHY YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN.THESE ANTI-JEB BUSH PRANKS.MESSING WITH THE BILLBOARD..INSTEAD OF SAYING DONALD TRUMP.IS UNHINGED ONE PERSON CHANGED.THE JEB BUSH QUOTE TO ""HAS.ANYONE SEEN MY TURTLE?"".SOMEBODY ELSE CHANGED -- I'M.SORRY ABOUT THIS ONE..SOMEBODY ELSE CHANGED IT TO.THIS..UH -- YEAH..AND YOU MIGHT EXPECT PEOPLE SORT.OF PROFANELY PRANKING A.CANDIDATE LIKE THAT FOR HAVING.PUT UP A BILLBOARD LIKE THIS..WHAT YOU WOULD NOT EXPECT IS FOR.JEB BUSH'S OWN DONORS, THE.PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT JUST.SUPPORTING HIM BUT WHO ARE.PUTTING MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTHS.ARE AND WHO ARE TRYING TO PAY.FOR HIM TO BECOME PRESIDENT,.THEIR DONORS WOULD ALSO DO THIS.SORT OF THING..APPARENTLY, THE WAY JEB BUSH.DONORS RESPONDED TO THIS.BILLBOARD, THE DONALD TRUMP IS.UNHINGED BILLBOARD-S THAT THEY.DID THEIR OWN PHOTOSHOP OF THE.BILLBOARD TO CHANGE IT TO THIS..IT'S ALSO A QUOTE..BUT THE QUOTE HERE IS SET ALL.OUR DONOR MONEY ON FIRE..AND THE QUOTE IS ATTRIBUTED TO.MIKE MURPHY, WHO'S THE GUY WHO.RUNS THE JEB BUSH SUPER PAC..MAYBE JEB BUSH HAS SOME SORT OF.SECRET IN STORE..MAYBE JEB BUSH HAS SOME ACTUAL.LOYALISTS WHO WON'T TALK SMACK.ABOUT HIM TO THE NEAREST.REPORTER IN A BACK POCKET.SOMEWHERE AND HE'S GOING TO ROLL.THEM OUT LATER..I DON'T KNOW..I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW THIS IS.GOING TO WORK OUT WELL FOR JEB.BUSH..THE LATEST IOWA POLL JUST OUT.FROM CNN TODAY HAS HIM AT 3% IN.IOWA, WHICH MEANS HE'S TIED WITH.MIKE HUCKABEE THERE..THE LATEST NEW HAMPSHIRE POLL.FROM CNN, IT'S OKAY..THAT ONE HAS HIM IN AT LEAST.DOUBLE DIGITS..AND THAT ONE POLL AT LEAST IN.NEW HAMPSHIRE HE'S TIED WITH.MARCO RUBIO FOR THIRD PLACE IN.NEW HAMPSHIRE..DONALD TRUMP AT 34..EXCUSE ME..TED CRUZ AT 14..AND THEN JEB AND MARCO BOTH TIED.AT 10% SUPPORT..MAYBE THAT'S HUGE NEWS..MAYBE JEB WILL PULL OFF SOME.GREAT UPSET OR HE'LL DO.UNEXPECTEDLY GREAT SOMEWHERE.ELSE..MAYBE HE'LL EVEN WIN IN SOUTH.CAROLINA..SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICANS KEEP.SAYING ON BACKGROUND THAT JEB.BUSH IS BEING UNDERESTIMATED IN.SOUTH CAROLINA, THAT THE BUSH.FAMILY HAS ALWAYS HAD SOUTH.CAROLINA WIRED IN REPUBLICAN.PRIMARIES AND JEB WILL BE NO.DIFFERENT..AND MAYBE THAT WILL HAPPEN..MAYBE HE'LL PULL THAT OFF..DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT, THOUGH,.DOES IT?.JEB BUSH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE.ESTABLISHMENT CHOICE IN THIS.ELECTION..THAT'S WHY RICH GUYS DUMPED OVER.$100 MILLION ON HIM BEFORE HE'D.EVEN DONE ANYTHING IN THE.CAMPAIGN..IN THIS ELECTION HE'S SUPPOSED.TO BE THE ESTABLISHMENT GUY..HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE PERSON.WHO REPUBLICANS WOULD ULTIMATELY.SETTLE ON AFTER THEY SPENT SOME.TIME FLIRTING WITH THE MORE.EXTREME CANDIDATES OR THE MORE.KOOKY CANDIDATES AND THEY CAME.TO THEIR SENSES AND DECIDED TO.GO WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT GUY.LIKE THEY ALWAYS DO..IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO BE JEB..HE WOULD BE THE ESTABLISHMENT.BACKUP..NOW LESS THAN TWO WEEKS FROM.IOWA IT'S BECOMING CLEAR THAT.THE ESTABLISHMENT BACKUP GUY,.THAT ROLE, THE GUY WHO EVERYBODY.FALLS BACK ON BECAUSE THEY THINK.THE OTHER CHOICES ARE TOO CRAZY,.NOW THAT ESTABLISHMENT ROLE IS.APPARENTLY GOING TO BE PLAYED BY.DONALD TRUMP..FRIDAY NIGHT, ""WASHINGTON POST"".REPORTER ROBERT COSTA BROKE THE.NEWS ON THIS SHOW THAT MULTIPLE.MAINSTREAM BIG DOLLAR REPUBLICAN.PARTY DONORS WERE SO DISGUSTED.BY THE PROSPECT OF TED CRUZ.DOING BETTER IN THE PRESIDENTIAL.POLLING THAT THEY HAD DECIDED TO.SUCK IT UP AND START SUPPORTING.DONALD TRUMP DESPITE ALL OF.THEIR MISGIVINGS ABOUT HIM AND.EVEN BAD THINGS THEY'D SAID.ABOUT HIM IN THE PAST..THE ""HILL"" NEWSPAPER YESTERDAY.FOLLOWED THAT REPORTING WITH A.LOT MORE DETAIL..A NUMBER OF OTHER MAINSTREAM BIG.DOLLAR REPUBLICAN DONORS WHO.WERE NOT JUST WILLING TO GIVE.BLIND QUOTES, THEY WERE WILLING.TO PUT THEIR NAMES ON THAT SAME.SENTIMENT, SAYING WHATEVER.MISGIVINGS THEY'D HAD IN THE.PAST, WHATEVER MISGIVINGS THEIR.FRIENDS MIGHT HAVE HAD ABOUT.DONALD TRUMP AT THE BEGINNING,.THEY DECIDING THAT HE'S THE ONE,.THEY'RE GOING TO SUPPORT,.THEY'RE ALL COMING AROUND..AND IT MAY BE THAT THESE DONORS.AND OLD SCHOOL REPUBLICAN TYPES.ARE WARMING UP TO DONALD TRUMP..THEY MAY BE LIKING MORE OF WHAT.THEY SEE IN DONALD TRUMP..IT MAY ALSO JUST BE THAT THEY'RE.HAVING THE OPPOSITE FEELING.ABOUT THE GUY WHO'S NEXT TO.TRUMP IN THE POLLS, SENATOR TED.CRUZ..BOB DOLE, FORMER REPUBLICAN.PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, TRENT.LOTT, FORMER SENATE MAJORITY.LEADER, IOWA GOVERNOR TERRY.BRANSTAD, THE CURRENT GOVERNOR.OF IOWA..UTAH SENATOR ORRIN HATCH WHO'S.THE SENIOR REPUBLICAN IN THE.SENATE RIGHT NOW, THEY ALL IN.THE LAST FEW DAYS HAVE GIVEN.EXPLICIT ON THE RECORD QUOTES.SAYING THEY BELIEVE TED CRUZ IN.PARTICULAR WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE.DISASTER FOR THE REPUBLICAN.PARTY AND THAT REPUBLICANS MUST.NOT SUPPORT HIM..HE WOULD BE THE WORST CHOICE..SENATOR RICHARD BURR, CURRENTLY.SERVING SENATOR FROM NORTH.CAROLINA, WAS DESCRIBED BY THE.ASSOCIATED PRESS TODAY AS HAVING.RECENTLY TOLD SUPPORTERS AT A.CAMPAIGN FUND-RAISER THAT IF HE.HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN VOTING FOR.HIS FELLOW REPUBLICAN SENATOR.TED CRUZ OR VOTING FOR BERNIE.SANDERS, HE SAYS HE'D VOTE FOR.BERNIE SANDERS..ACCORDING TO THE ASSOCIATED.PRESS, ""SENATOR BURR DID NOT.APPEAR TO BE JOKING."".SO JEB BUSH IS TRYING TO STAY.ABOVE WATER, AMID THIS TIDE OF.HATE AND DISLOYALTY AND DERISION.FROM HIS OWN SUPPOSED.SUPPORTERS..DONALD TRUMP IS CURRENTLY.SURFING A WAVE OF HATE FOR TED.CRUZ, WHICH BY CONTRAST I.SUPPOSE IS BOLSTERING MR..TRUMP'S IMAGE, LESSENING THE.RESISTANCE TO HIM PARTICULARLY.AMONG BIG MONEY DONORS AND BIG.NAMES IN THE REPUBLICAN.ESTABLISHMENT..THAT SAID, HERE COMES ANOTHER.BIG WAVE OF HATE IN A DIFFERENT.DIRECTION THAT IS DUE TO CRUST.AND BREAK TOMORROW MORNING..""THE NEW YORK TIMES"" SAYS.JONATHAN MARTIN REPORTS TONIGHT.THAT TOMORROW MORNING A GROUP OF.WHAT HE CALLS CONSERVATIVE.INTELLECTUALS ARE GOING TO ISSUE.AN

FEDERAL.ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.ANNOUNCED A SWEEPING SET OF.CHANGES IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO.THE LEAD POISE ONG OF FLINT..THE EPA HAS FACED CRITICISM FOR.NOT STEPPING IN MORE FORCEFULLY.WHEN THEY REALIZED FLINT HAD.MUCH HIGHER LEVELS OF LEAD IN.ITS WATER WHICH THEY REALIZED.ALMOST A YEAR AGO NOW..IF WAS AN EPA WHISTLEBLOWER, ONE.EMPLOYEE ACTING ON HIS OWN WHO.ISSUED A WARNING ABOUT HIGH LEAD.LEVELS IN FLINT..HE DID THAT LAST JUNE..WHEN THAT ONE EMPLOYEE TOOK THAT.EXTRAORDINARY STEP BASICALLY.OUTSIDE OF THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.AT EPA, THE EPA'S REGION THE.DIRECTOR TOLD FLINT OFFICIALS AT.THE TIME THAT THIS WARNING FROM.THIS ONE GUY FROM THE EPA, THAT.WAS JUST A PRELIMINARY DRAFT, IT.SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RELEASED..NOW TONIGHT THAT REGIONAL.DIRECTOR IS OUT..THAT REGIONAL DIRECTOR HAS.RESIGNED..AND THE EPA'S ADMINISTRATOR,.JANET McKARTHY, HAS ACCEPTED HER.RESIGNATION..THE HIGH-RANKING EPA OFFICIAL.WHO WAS IN CHARGE OVERSIGHT FOR.MICHIGAN WHEN FLINT WAS POISONED.HE HAD SHE HAS

POST.THE RESULTS ONLINE FOR THE.PUBLIC..SHE'S ALSO INSTRUCTED ALL.STAFFERS AT THE EPA TO SPEAK UP.AND SPEAK OUT WHENEVER THEY SEE.A PROBLEM LIKE THE ONE THAT JUST.HAPPENED IN FLINT..THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING NEW.CHANGE THAT REFLECTS SOME SOUL.SEARCHING AT THE EPA..IF EPA EMPLOYEES SEE ""A.SUBSTANTIAL THREAT TO HEALTH OR.IF THE EPA COULD ACT TO HELP OR.IF OTHER AUTHORITIES APPEAR.UNABLE TO HELP OR IF HIGH AND.SUSTAINED PUBLIC ATTENTION IS.POSSIBLE, IF THEY RUN INTO A.SITUATION LIKE THAT THEY ARE TO.BLOW THE WHISTLE RIGHT AWAY."".NEW RULE AT THE EPA..""THIS POLICY IS EFFECTIVE.IMMEDIATELY."".IN MICHIGAN TODAY THERE WAS THIS.RASH OF HEADLINES DECLARING THAT.CONGRESS WOULD BE HOLDING A.HEARING ON THE FLINT CRISIS..THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS..THIS RASH OF HEADLINES THAT SAID.GOVERNOR RICK SNYDER WAS GOING.TO BE CALLED TO WASHINGTON, HE.WOULD BE FORCED TO TESTIFY.BEFORE CONGRESS ABOUT FLINT..AND THAT WOULD BE A HUGE DEAL IF.IT WERE TRUE..IF THAT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING,.THAT WOULD BE A BIG DEAL..THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING..FIRST OF ALL, NOBODY'S BEING.TOLD TO TESTIFY..NOBODY'S BEING SUBPOENAED..RICK SNYDER WAS ONE OF SEVERAL.PEOPLE CONGRESS, OR AT LEAST A.PART OF CONGRESS, REPORTEDLY.WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM ON THIS.TOPIC..SO THOSE HEADLINES VERY QUICKLY.GOT REVISED..RICK SNYDER WAS BEING INVITED TO.A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING..BUT THEN IT TURNED OUT THAT THE.PERSON REQUESTING THIS SUPPOSED.HEARING IS A DEMOCRAT..ON THIS ONE SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE.OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE..AND WHEN YOU ARE IN THE.MINORITY, WHEN YOU ARE A.DEMOCRAT IN A.REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED CONGRESS,.YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO CALL.HEARINGS..ONLY THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE IN.CHARGE CAN DO THAT..SO YES, THIS IS THIS ONE.DEMOCRAT ON THAT SUBCOMMITTEE.SAYING WE WOULD LOVE TO HOLD A.HEARING ON THAT SUBJECT, BUT.NOTHING HAS ACTUALLY BEEN.SCHEDULED..RICK SNYDER I GUESS COULD BE.INVITED TO TALK TO CONGRESS,.SURE..BUT HE HAS NOT BEEN SO FAR.DESPITE HEADLINES YOU MIGHT HAVE.SEEN ON THAT SUBJECT TO THE.CONTRARY TODAY..THE OTHER NEWS OUT OF MICHIGAN.TODAY CONCERNS NOT LEAD.POISONING BUT A FATAL OUTBREAK.OF LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE IN AND.AROUND FLINT, AN OUTBREAK THAT.TOOK PLACE IN 2014 AND 2015 BUT.WE JUST LEARNED ABOUT IT LAST.WEEK..IN FACT, THE GOVERNOR SAID HE.JUST LEARNED ABOUT IT LAST WEEK..BETWEEN JUNE 2014 AND OCTOBER OF.LAST YEAR GENESEE COUNTY WHERE.FLINT IS, THEY HAD 87 CASES OF.LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE..AT LEAST NINE OF THOSE PEOPLE.DIED..LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE, IT'S A.RESPIRATORY DISEASE THAT'S.CAUSED BY WATER-BORNE BACTERIA..AND THE SPIKE IN THAT DISEASE IN.GENESEE COUNTY, IT STARTED TWO.MONTHS AFTER FLINT SWITCHED ITS.WATER SOURCE TO THE FLINT RIVER.IN APRIL OF 2014..IN A NEW REPORT ON THIS.LEGIONNAIRE'S OUTBREAK THAT WAS.ISSUED TODAY, MICHIGAN'S HEALTH.DEPARTMENT SAYS IT ""CANNOT.CONCLUDE THAT THE INCREASE IS.RELATED TO THE WATER SWITCH IN.FLINT, NOR CAN WE RULE OUT A.POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION AT THIS.TIME."".WHAT WE DO KNOW AS OF TODAY IS.THAT THE STATE KNEW ABOUT THIS.SPIKE IN LEGIONNAIRES' AS OF.2014 AND OFFICIALS DISCUSSED THE.POSSIBILITY IT COULD BE RELATED.TO THE WATER SWITCH IN OCTOBER.OF THAT YEAR..WE ALSO KNOW THE STATE HEALTH.OFFICIALS THOUGHT THE OUTBREAK.WAS OVER AS OF THE SPRING OF.2015..AFTER 45 CASES AND FINE DEATHS..IN MARCH 2015 THEY SAID, ""THIS.OUTBREAK IS OVER."".BUT THEN THEREAFTER, THAT WAS IN.MARCH -- EXCUSE ME, THAT WAS IN.MAY 2015..THEN THEREAFTER BETWEEN MAY AND.OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR TURNS OUT.IT WASN'T OVER..THERE WERE ANOTHER 42 CASES AND.FOUR MORE DEATHS..AGAIN, THIS LEGIONNAIRES' SPIKE.IN AND AROUND FLINT IS NOT.CONCLUSIVELY TIED TO THE SWITCH.OF THE FLINT WATER SUPPLY BUT IF.IT DOES EVENTUALLY GET TIED TO.THAT, IF THE SWITCH TO THE FLINT.RIVER AND THE UNSAFE WAY IN.WHICH THEY DID IT NOT ONLY.CAUSED THE LEAD POISONING BUT.ALSO CAUSED THIS LEGIONNAIRES'.DISEASE THING, THEN THE TOLL.THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO FAR,.THE HUMAN TOLL FROM THAT POLICY.DECISION MADE BY THE RICK SNYDER.ADMINISTRATION, THE HUMAN TOLL.IS MORE THAN 6,000 KIDS LEAD.POISONED IN MICHIGAN PLUS TENS.OF THOUSANDS OF ADULTS EXPOSED.TO LEAD IN MICHIGAN AND AT LEAST.NINE DEATHS SO FAR AND COUNTING..JOINING US NOW FROM FLINT IS.TONY DEKOPPEL, NATIONAL REPORTER.FOR NBC..HE'S BEEN LOOKING INTO.SPECIFICALLY THE LEGIONNAIRES'.DISEASE SPIKE IN FLINT..TONY, IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU.HERE..THANKS FOR JOINING US..>> GLAD TO BE HERE..>> WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES PEOPLE.THINK THE LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE.SPIKE COULD BE RELATED TO THE.SAME THING THAT DID THE LEAD.POISONING THING, THIS WATER.SOURCE SWITCH?.>> WELL, THE FIRST THING IS JUST.HOW BIG IT IS AND THE TIMING.THAT YOU POINTED OUT P I WANT TO.GIVE PEOPLE AN IDEA OF THE SCALE.HERE..87 CASES IN THIS COUNTY..THAT'S ABOUT NINE TIMES BIGGER.THAN THE AVERAGE NATIONAL.OUTBREAK..PER CAPITA..IT'S BIGGER THAN THAT MASSIVE.BRONX OUTBREAK THAT WE COVERED.LAST YEAR..IT'S MORE LETHAL THAN THAT.OUTBREAK..THERE'S NOT EVEN A RECORD OF.ANYONE DYING OF LEGIONNAIRES' IN.THIS COUNTY WE COULD FIND OVER.THE LAST FIVE YEARS..SO THIS IS HUGE..THE STATE SAYS THEY CAN'T BE.CERTAIN IT'S RELATED TO THE.WATER BUT AT THE SAME TIME THEY.CAN'T RULE IT OUT..WELL, I TALKED TO FIVE DIFFERENT.DOCTORS AND RESEARCHERS TODAY.AND THEY ARE ALL SURE AS THEY.CAN BE THAT THERE IS A.CONNECTION..AND RESEARCHERS FROM VIRGINIA.TECH IN PARTICULAR VIRGINIA TECH.RESEARCHERS HAVE BEEN ON THE.GROUND HERE THROUGHOUT THE LEAD.CRISIS..THEY'VE BEEN LEADING THAT.CHARGE..THEY WERE SO SURE THAT THERE.WOULD ALSO BE A LEGIONNAIRES'.OUTBREAK THAT THEY WROTE A GRANT.FOR IT..THEY PREDICTED IT WOULD HAPPEN..THEY DID LABORATORY TESTS..THEY WROTE A GRANT..AND THEN THEY CAME HERE TO THE.VERY HOSPITAL IDENTIFIED IN THE.STATE REPORT WHERE MOST OF THESE.OUTBREAKS OCCURRED AND THEY.FOUND LEGIONNAIRIA BACTERIA.THERE..AND THEY KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO.HAPPEN BECAUSE WHENEVER THERE'S.CORROSION CORROSION IS ALL THE.THING THAT CAUSED THE LEAD TO.LEACH INTO THE WATER..WHENEVER THERE'S CORROSION.THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF IRON AND.BACTERIA REALLY LOVES IRON..JUST LIKE WE HAVE VITAMINS THAT.MAKES OUR BODY STRONG, MAKES.BACTERIA STRONG TOO..LEGIONNAIRES' GROWS AS A RESULT..SO THERE'S THIS DO-SI-DO..THERE'S THE LEAD AND SOMETIME.TAINSI RESEARCHERS EXPECT TO SEE.THE LEGIONNALIA AND NOW THEY.FEAR THEIR CONVICTIONS HAVE COME.TO PASS..>> YOU TALKED TO FIVE DIFFERENT.RESEARCHERS WHO SAY THEY'RE ALL.SURE THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THIS.MUST BE -- THAT THE.LEGIONNAIRES' MUST BE ALSO.LINKED TO THE WATER SWITCH..OBVIOUSLY, THAT IS -- THAT'S.COMPELLING BUT THEY'VE GOT TO.PROVE IT PRESUMABLY IN SOME MORE.CONCLUSIVE WAY BEFORE THEY CAN.TRY TO GET HELP TO DEAL WITH IT?.IS IT BEING -- IS SOMEBODY.TRYING TO MAKE IT A CONCLUSIVE.LINK?.>> WELL, HERE'S WHAT'S SO.FRUSTRATING ABOUT, THIS AND THIS.IS ALSO IN THE STATE REPORT.TODAY..THEY WILL NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN.THAT THIS IS A RESULT OF THE.SWITCH -- THE SWITCH OF THE.WATER SOURCE..THEY'LL NEVER KNOW FOR CERTAIN.BECAUSE THE STATE DIDN'T TAKE.THE PROPER CULTURES AND THEY.ADMIT THIS IN THEIR RELEASE..THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE CULTURES.NECESSARY TO DEFINITIVELY TRACE.THE SOURCE OF THE OUTBREAK BACK.TO SOME ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSE..SO WE WILL NEVER KNOW

AND TOUGHER TONE.BETWEEN SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS.AND FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE.HILLARY CLINTON..AND PARTICULARLY IN THE LAST.COUPLE OF DAYS THAT IS MOSTLY.BECAUSE OF A DISPUTE OVER.ENDORSEMENTS FOR HILLARY CLINTON.FROM SOME BIG NAME PROGRESSIVE.ORGANIZATIONS..AND THAT WHOLE DISPUTE STARTED.RIGHT HERE..LITERALLY ON THIS SHOW..HERE'S HOW SENATOR SANDERS.ANSWERED MY QUESTION ABOUT THOSE.ENDORSEMENTS ON TUESDAY NIGHT..>> I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE.ENDORSEMENT OF EVERY PROGRESSIVE.ORGANIZATION IN AMERICA..WE'RE VERY PROUD TO HAVE.RECEIVED RECENTLY THE.ENDORSEMENT OF MOVEON.ORG..WE'VE RECEIVED THE ENDORSEMENT.OF DEMOCRACY FOR AMERICA..THESE ARE GRASSROOTS.ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING.MILLIONS OF WORKER..WHAT WE ARE DOING IN THIS.CAMPAIGN, IT JUST BLOWS MY MIND.EVERY DAY BECAUSE I SEE IT.CLEARLY..WE'RE TAKING ON NOT ONLY WALL.STREET AND THE ECONOMIC.ESTABLISHMENT..WE'RE TAKING ON THE POLITICAL.ESTABLISHMENT..SO I HAVE FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS.IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS FUND, IN.PLANNED PARENTHOOD..BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?.HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN AROUND.THERE FOR A VERY, VERY LONG.TIME, AND SOME OF THESE GROUPS.ARE IN FACT PART OF THE.ESTABLISHMENT..>> THAT WAS SENATOR SANDERS.SPEAKING ON THIS SHOW ON TUESDAY.NIGHT..BOTH SENATOR SANDERS AND.SECRETARY CLINTON ARE VERY PRO.GAY RIGHTS AND VERY PRO CHOICE..SO THIS IS NOT A FIGHT THAT IS.ABOUT BIG BLACK-AND-WHITE POLICY.DIFFERENCES..BUT IT NEVERTHELESS HAS BECOME A.BIG BLACK-AND-WHITE FIGHT..>> I WAS PROUD TO BE ENDORSED BY.THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACTION.FUND BECAUSE OF THE WORK I'VE.DONE FOR SO MANY YEARS TO DEFEND.WOMEN'S HEALTH..AND I WAS PROUD TO BE SUPPORTED.AND ENDORSED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS.CAMPAIGN BECAUSE OF THE WORK.I'VE DONE TO END DISCRIMINATION.AGAINST THE LGBT COMMUNITY..[ APPLAUSE ].AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, I WAS.SOMEWHAT CONFUSED WHEN SENATOR.SANDERS SAID, WELL, PLANNED.PARENTHOOD AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS.CAMPAIGN, THEY'RE PART OF THE.ESTABLISHMENT AND THAT'S WHY.THEY'RE SUPPORTING HILLARY.CLINTON, BECAUSE IT'S ALL PART.OF THE ESTABLISHMENT..I THOUGHT, BOY, I WISH IT WERE..I WISH WE WEREN'T FIGHTING ALL.THE TIME TO PROTECT WOMEN'S.RIGHTS, TO PROTECT WOMEN'S.HEALTH..IF IT WERE PART OF THE.ESTABLISHMENT, THAT WOULD BE.TIME FOR ALL OF US TO JUST QUIT.HAVING TO WORK SO HARD AND.DEFEND IT AND FIGHT FOR IT..WELL, THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE..WE HAVE TO KEEP WORKING TO MAKE.SURE PEOPLE ARE NOT TAKEN.ADVANTAGE OF, NOT STRIPPED OF.THEIR RIGHTS..AND THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO DO.ALL OF THAT..>> SO AFTER THIS FIGHT ERUPTED.ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND THESE.GROUPS THAT ENDORSE SECRETARY.CLINTON CAME OUT AND SAID THEY.WERE UPSET BY HOW SENATOR.SANDERS HAD CHARACTERIZED THEM,.I SAID LAST NIGHT HERE ON THE.SHOW THAT WE WANTED TO CHECK.BACK IN WITH SENATOR BERNIE.SANDERS TO SEE IF HE THOUGHT.THAT HIS REMARKS HAD BEEN.MISCONSTRUED OR IF HE WANTED TO.CLARIFY HIS REMARKS OR IF HE.WANTED TO REITERATE THEM..SENATOR SANDERS WAS NOT.AVAILABLE LAST NIGHT..HE WAS CAMPAIGNING ALL DAY TODAY.IN NEW HAMPSHIRE..BUT WE WERE FINALLY ABLE TO.CATCH UP WITH HIM TODAY TO GET.HIS RESPONSE..MSNBC'S KACI HUNT HAD A CHANCE.TO ASK HIM ONE ON ONE WHEN SHE.MET HIM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE..AND THIS IS REALLY INTERESTING..THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY..>> YOU MADE SOME REMARKS TO.RACHEL MADDOW ON MSNBC THE OTHER.DAY AND YOU PUT PLANNED.PARENTHOOD AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS.CAMPAIGN, SOME OF THESE OTHER.GROUPS, IN THE CATEGORY OF THE.ESTABLISHMENT..DO YOU STILL --.>> NO, I DIDN'T..THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT..THE QUESTION WAS THAT -- THAT'S.NOT WHAT THE QUESTION WAS..THE QUESTION WAS THE.ENDORSEMENT..>> MM-HMM..>> I AM A VERY, VERY STRONG.SUPPORTER OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD..I THINK THEY ARE DOING A.FANTASTIC JOB ON THE VERY.DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES..VERY STRONG SUPPORTER OF NARAL..STRONG SUPPORTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS.FUND..AND I HAVE I THINK A 100% VOTING.RECORD FOR ALL OF THESE.ORGANIZATIONS..WHAT I SAID IN RESPONSE TO A.QUESTION ABOUT ENDORSEMENTS IS I.THINK -- WHAT I MEANT TO SAY.ANYHOW, IS THAT SOMETIMES THE.GRASSROOTS ARE ASKING HOW DOES.IT HAPPEN, THAT SOMEBODY HAS A.100% VOTING RECORD IN SUPPORT OF.YOUR ISSUE AND DOESN'T GET.ENDORSED AND THAT SOMETIMES THE.LEADERSHIP OF AN ORGANIZATION.MAY LOOK AT THE WORLD A LITTLE.DIFFERENTLY THAN THE GRASSROOTS..BUT NEFRMZ THOSE ORGANIZATIONS I.KNOW WE'RE A WEEK OUT OF AN.ELECTION AND THE CLINTON PEOPLE.TRY TO SPIN THESE THINGS..I AM A FIERCE SUPPORTER OF.PLANNED PARENTHOOD, NARAL, AND.GAY RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY..>> AND THEY ARE NOT PART OF THE.ESTABLISHMENT?.>> NO..THEY'RE STANDING UP AND FIGHTING.THE IMPORTANT FIGHTS THAT HAVE.TO BE FOUGHT..OKAY?.>> PLANNED PARENTHOOD, NARAL AND.OTHERS ARE NOT PART OF THE.ESTABLISHMENT..SENATOR SANDERS CLARIFYING.SAYING THAT'S WHAT HE MEANT,.TELLING KACI HUNT THAT THOSE.GROUPS ARE STANDING UP AND.FIGHTING THE IMPORTANT FIGHTS.THAT HAVE TO BE FOUGHT..HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF AS A FIERCE.SUPPORTER OF THOSE GROUPS..SO DOES THAT END THIS FIGHT ON.THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE?.IS THIS ALL JUST ONE BIG.MISUNDERSTANDING LIKE THE WAY.EVERY EPISODE OF ""THREE'S.COMPANY"" ALWAYS WORKED OUT IN.THE END?.JACK'S NOT REALLY GAY..JOINING US NOW IS KASEY HUNT,.MSNBC'S POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT..THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR.TIME TONIGHT..I HOPE I DIDN'T JUST BLOW THE.WHOLE PLOT OF ""THREE'S COMPANY"".FOR YOU BEFORE YOU HAD A CHANCE.TO FINISH..>> NOT AT ALL..>> SO SENATOR SANDERS TODAY,.OBVIOUSLY YOU HAD THAT.CONVERSATION INITIALLY WITH ME.ON TUESDAY NIGHT..HIS CAMPAIGN BEFORE THAT.CONVERSATION WITH ME ON TUESDAY.NIGHT, HAD PUT OUT A STATEMENT.USING THE TERM ""ESTABLISHMENT"".SPECIFICALLY I THINK ABOUT THE.HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN.ENDORSEMENT..SO IT WASN'T A TOTAL SURPRISE.THAT HE WENT THERE..IS HE REALLY SAYING THIS HAS.BEEN MISCONSTRUED, THIS IS NOT.WHAT I MEANT, I WANT TO TAKE.THIS BACK?.HE SORT OF DEFENDED IT AND TOOK.IT BACK WHEN SPOKE WITH YOU..>> HE DID..HE SORT OF TOOK ISSUE WITH THE.FRAMING OF YOUR QUESTION BUT.THEN SAID UNEQUIVOCALLY THAT.THESE GROUPS ARE NOT PART OF THE.ESTABLISHMENT, WHICH I THINK IT.WAS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO A.CERTAIN EXTENT THAT THIS HAD.BECOME SOMETHING OF AN ISSUE FOR.HIM, SOMETHING HE DID HAVE TO.CLEAN UP..AS WALKBACKS GO IN POLITICS THIS.ONE WAS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD,.PRETTY CLEAR, NO, I DON'T THINK.THESE GROUPS ARE PART OF THE.ESTABLISHMENT..TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IT WAS CLEAR.HILLARY CLINTON HAD FOUND A WAY.TO POTENTIALLY DRIVE A WEDGE.BETWEEN BERNIE SANDERS AND SOME.OF THESE VERY PASSIONATE LIBERAL.BASE VOTERS WHO HAVE BEEN.SUPPORTING HIM, AND THAT OF.COURSE IS A PRETTY RARE CHANCE.FOR HER..SHE'S JUMPED ON IT IN OTHER.AREAS TOO..YOU LOOK AT GUNS, FOR EXAMPLE,.ANOTHER PLACE WHERE THAT'S.HAPPENED..>> KASIE, DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE.FROM BEING OUT THERE ON THE.CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND FROM SPENDING.TIME PARTICULARLY AROUND BERNIE.SANDERS SUPPORTERS AS YOU'RE OUT.THERE ON THE TRAIL, DO YOU GET.ANY SENSE THAT THIS IS SINKING.IN, THAT THIS FIGHT BETWEEN THE.CAMPAIGNS, AND IT'S A PRETTY.SHARP-EDGED FIGHT BETWEEN THE.CAMPAIGNS, IS SOMETHING THAT IS.MOTIVATING OR BOTHERING YOUR.AVERAGE NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTER.WHO'S OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.TO SEE THEIR CANDIDATE?.>> WELL, LOOK, I THINK THE WAY.THIS FIGHT BETWEEN HILLARY.CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS HAS.SUDDENLY EXPLODED IS JUST THE.EVIDENCE THAT FRANKLY THE MEDIA.IS CATCHING UP TO THE NARRATIVE.THAT'S BEEN GOING ON ON THE.GROUND..I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING.BOTH WITH BERNIE SANDERS.SUPPORTERS WHO HAD COME TO SEE.HIM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BUT ALSO TO.MAINLY STUDENTS WHO WERE AROUND.US BUT TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER.OR NOT TO GO SEE BERNIE SANDERS..AND EVEN IF THEY WEREN'T SUPER.ENGAGED IN POLITICS THEY ALL.SAID, YOU KNOW, MY FRIENDS ARE.REALLY INTO BERNIE SANDERS AND.WHEN YOU ASK THEM WHAT IS THE.BASSLINE OF WHAT YOU KNOW..IF YOU KNOW ONE THING ABOUT.BERNIE SANDERS, WHAT IS IT?.AND IF YOU KNOW ONE THING ABOUT.HILLARY CLINTON, WHAT IS IT?.THEY ALMOST TO A PERSON CAME.BACK AND SAID, WELL, BERNIE.SANDERS SEEMS LIKE AN.INTERESTING GUY WHO SAYS WLAEL.THINKS AND HILLARY CLINTON COMES.ACROSS LIKE SHE'S CALCULATING.EVERYTHING..THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT ON.BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE RIGHT.NOW IS SUCH YOU THAT DO NOT WANT.TO BE THE PERSON THAT'S COMING.ACROSS AS CALCULATED..AND I THINK YOU SEE THAT IN THE.WAY BOTH BERNIE SANDERS AND.HILLARY CLINTON ARE TREATING.THIS WORD ESTABLISHMENT LIKE.THIS IS SUCH A DIRTY WORD..HILLARY CLINTON TODAY WAS OUT.BASICALLY SAYING BERNIE SANDERS.IS MORE ESTABLISHMENT THAN I.HE'S BEEN IN CONGRESS FOR 25.YEARS, I'VE ONLY BEEN IN OFFICE.FOR EIGHT YEARS..I'M LESS ESTABLISHMENT THAN HE.IS..THAT'S A DIFFICULT ARGUMENT TO.WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND, BUT.THAT'S WHERE WE ARE IN THIS.DEMOCRATIC RACE..>> SHE ALSO GOT IT WHEN SHE.DIDN'T GET HER EXPECTED CROWD.RESPONSE WHEN SHE SAID I WISH.PLANNED PARENTHOOD WAS.ESTABLISHMENT..WANTING TO BE ESTABLISHMENT.SOUNDS LIKE AN EPITHET EVEN IN.THAT CONTEXT..THANK YOU VERY MUCH, CASEY,.APPRECIATE IT..>> THANKS, RACHEL..NICE TO SEE YOU..>> MUCH MORE AHEAD..STAY WITH

STARTED AT THE.MOORE.HOUSE CHAPTER..AND THEY CONTINUE TO REACH OUT..NEXT WEEK AT DAYTONA BEACH, AND.THEY ARE GETTING OUT..I THINK THAT THE OTHER THING.THAT THE PARTY IS REALIZING.FROM THEIR AUTOPSY IS

AS AMERICANS, ONE OF.MY THINGS IS I'M NOT A PURIST..BUT I WANT EVERYONE TO BE.INFORMED OF THEIR PRINCIPLES.AND VALUES, AND ONE OF THE WAYS.THAT WE PIERCE THROUGH SOME OF.THE BARRIERS THAT ARE BEFORE

MUCH.PASSIONATE..I THINK THAT VOTER APATHY IS,.IF WE LOOK AT IT AS WE.HAVE, WE.SAY FOLKS DON'T CARE, AND.THEY'RE DISENGAGED, BUT I THINK.THAT VOTER APATHY SHOULD BE.LOOKED AT DIFFERENTLY, AS A.FORM OF PROTEST..SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT.INTERESTED IN A DYSFUNCTIONAL.SYSTEM, OR A DEMOCRACY THAT.DOESN'T PROMOTE OUR HE IDEALS,.AND WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN.PROMOTING A PROCESS OF.GOVERNING THAT HAS FAILED TO.MAKE GOOD ON ITS.PROMISES..>> HOLD THAT THOUGHT UNTIL THE.LAST PART OF THE PROGRAM.BECAUSE I WANT TO LEAVE TIME.FOR NON-VOTING AS A POLITICAL.STATEMENT..AND WE'LL PICK IT UP WITH YOU,.AND ONE THING IN A IS UNITES.OUR GUESTS IS A.FORWARD-LOOKING.OPTIMISTIC IT DESIRE TO BRING.VOTING OFF THE SIDELINES AND.INTO THE FRAY..WHAT WORKS TO TURN A NON-VOTER.INTO A.VOTER?.>>  YOU'RE WATCHING ""INSIDE.STORY"", AND I'M RAY SUAREZ..MILLENNIALS AND THE 2016 VOTE.THIS TIME..MY GUESTS ARE STILL WITH ME,.AND ASHLEA, WE WERE TALKING.ABOUT COMING OF AGE DURING THIS.PARTICULAR.TIME, A TOUGH TIME.TO BE ENTERING YOUR ADULT.YEARS, AND HOW DOES THAT.DISCOURAGE OR ENCOURAGE VOTERS?.>>  WELL, I THINK ABOUT THE.FACT THAT MILLENNIALS, THE.OLDEST WAS ONLY 27 WHEN THE.ECONOMIC CRISIS HIT..AND THEY HAVE BEEN.TRUCKING.STRUGGLING.WITH A NUMBER OF ISSUES..WE TOOK A POLL IN THE LAST.WEEKS THAT SHOW THAT THE.ECONOMY IS THE TOP.ISSUE, STUDENT LOAN DEBT AND.THE ENVIRONMENT..AND WHAT IS BORN OUT IN THOSE.NUMBERS, THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CARE.VERY MUCH ABOUT THE ISSUES, AND.THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE.SAME THING THAT MANY OF THE.REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THIS.COUNTRY ARE..ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE POLL.THAT WE THOUGHT WAS THAT 75% OF.YOUNG PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT.VOTING IS A WAY TO HAVE AN.IMPACT ON THE ISSUES THAT THEY.CARE ABOUT..SIMULTANEOUS TO THAT, THERE'S A.DISTRUST OF THE INSTITUTION AND.THE PROCESS OF VOTING, SO AS A.COUNTRY, WE HAVE A.RESPONSIBILITY TO DO A BETTER.JOB OF BRINGING YOUNG PEOPLE,.WHO WE HAVE TOARE NOT JUST.YOUNG PEOPLE, BUT THEY'RE NEW.VOTERS AND NEW TO THE PROCESS.OF WE NO LONGER HAVE A ROBUST.SITUATION TO GET THEM ARRANGED..ONE THING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN.DOING FOR YEARS IS MAKING.SENIOR THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE.FAMILIAR WITH THE PROCESS TO.ACCESS THE VOTER REGISTRATION,.AND IT'S EASY, AND THE LAWS ARE.ES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU NEED.TO BRING WITH YOU TO THE POLLS,.VOTER EDUCATION AND WHO IS ON.THE BALLOT..>> IT BECOMES AN ISSUE ONCE.SOMEBODY DECIDES TO VOTE..THOSE THINGS COME INTO PLAY.ABSOLUTELY..BUT I'M THINKING ABOUT THE.YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT THEY.SHUG, AND I DON'T VOTE, I'M NOT.INTERESTED..AND I'M NOT AWARE OF WHO.THE CANDIDATES ARE, WHO THEY.FIGHT OVER, OR I'M JUST TIRED.OF THE WHOLE THING..HOW DO YOU PULL THOSE PEOPLE.IN?.IS IT WORTH DOING?.IS THERE A HIGH COST PER VOTER.COMPARED TO A 40-YEAR-OLD OR.60-YEAR-OLD?.>> YES, OF COURSE..THERE'S A LOT OF SHARED.RESPONSIBILITY.TO GO AROUND..RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE A SYSTEM.WHERE PEOPLE ARE FOCUSED ON.ENGAGING OLDER PEOPLE WHO ARE.MORE CONSISTENT VOTERS, WHICH.IS, BY THE WAY, WHAT HAPPENS.WHEN YOU HAVE A GOOD CIVIC.EDUCATION PROCESS IN PLACE, AND.PEOPLE DEVELOP HABITS TO VOTING.AND CONTINUE TO DO SO AS.THEY'RE OLDER, AND ALSO, I.ACTUALLY DISAGREE THAT YOUNG.PEOPLE ARE APATHETIC, AND AS.TRISTEN WAS SAYING, YOUNG.PEOPLE CARE VERY MUCH..AND THEY'RE GETTING INVOLVED IN.A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT.THEY THINK ARE VALUABLE..HIGHER VOLUNTEER RATES, AND.RARE.COULDN'TINGBUTION RATES TO.NON-PROFITS, EVERY YOUNG PERSON.ON THIS PANEL IS FIGHTING TO.INSPIRE TO GET HER.PEERS TO BE.MORE ACTIVE IN THE PROCESS AND.MORE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED.IN THE MILITARY..WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF.ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT.MILLENNIALS CARE B. BY.CANDIDATES ADDRESSING THEM IS.TACKLING THE ISSUES THAT MATTER.FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE..>>.ASHLEY IS RIGHT, I SHOULDN'T.HAVE USED SHORTHAND..THEY ARE INTERESTED AND THEY'RE.FOLLOWING, BUT THEY DON'T DRAW.A LINE FROM THAT INTEREST AND.PASSION AND INTEREST TO THE ACT.OF VOTING AS A TASK THAT.ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHES ANYTHING..IS THAT FAIR?.>> I WOULD SAY FOR THIS.CONVERSATION, THAT'S PROBABLY.FAIR..BUT I THINK THAT ASHLEY MAKES A.CRITICAL POINT WHEN SHE SAYS WE.HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF.GAMING..THE LINCHPIN TO THE ENTIRE.CONVERSATION ABOUT VOTING AND.PROCESSING.AND PARTICIPATION IS.ENGAGEMENT..AND EARLIER, BEFORE WE BEGAN.THE SHOW, YOU MENTIONED THAT IN.STATES WHERE THERE'S A.HIGHER.TURNOUT AMONG MILLENNIALS,.THERE'S A HIGHER TURNOUT AMONG.ADULTS SO..WHAT'S THE CORRELATION THERE?.BEING AN ADULT AND PURCHASING A.HOME AND BEING ABLE TO ENGAGE.IN THE COMMUNITY IN WAYS THAT.YOU CAN'T, AND YOU DON'T HAVE A.JOB AND YOU ARE BURIED UNDER BE.RESPONSIBILITY OF ADULTHOOD..IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE, AND.YOU'RE NOT LIKELY TO, ON YOUR.OWN BE ENGAGED BECAUSE YOU.CAN'T BE CONCERNED ABOUT THINGS.WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FEED.YOURSELF..BUT HOWEVER, IF CAMPAIGNS ARE.MAKING A PITCH, THEY COME TO.ENGAGE YOU, AND THEY MAKE THAT.EFFORT, WHATEVER THE COST MAY.BE, I THINK THAT WE SEE THAT.NON-VOTER ALL OF A SUDDEN SEE.THEMSELVES IN THE PROCESS..>> WELL,.CHELSEA, YOU'VE RUN.FOR OFFICE, AND WHAT'S THE.PITCH?.IVE ME THE ELEVATOR PITCH TO.GET A YOUNG NON-VOTER INTO THE.BOOTH AND VOTING FOR YOU, I.GUESS, IF YOU WANT TO MAKE.IT.PERSONAL?.>>  WHAT I DID WHEN I ARE NOT.FOR LOCAL OFFICE IN.JACKSONVILLE, I SHARED MY.EXPERIENCES OF GOING ABROAD AND.SHARED THE GLOBAL WATER CRISIS,.AND HOW I WAS GOING TO DO THAT.KNOWLEDGE TO IMPACT THE CITY OF.JACKSONVILLE, THE ST. JOHN'S.RIVER THERE IN JACKSONVILLE,.BUT NOT ONLY THAT, BUT I FOUND.OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WHAT.THEIR WERE, AND WHAT THEY WERER.CONCERNED ABOUT, AND I DOESN'T.WANT TO JUST TALK TO PEOPLE,.BUT I IS FOLLOWED UP WITH.PEOPLE, THERE IT ENGAGED AND.ACTIVE, SO ONE OF THE THINGS.THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT.WHEN YOU'RE REACHING OUT TO A.VOTER IS TO LISTEN AND.UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE.SAYING,.TO BECOME INFORMED ON THE.ISSUES THAT THEY CARE ABOUT,.AND THEN CONTINUE TO REACH OUT.TO THEM..BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE FEEL THAT.YOU CARE ABOUT THEM, IT'S ONE.OF THE SUREST WAYS TO GET THEM.INTERESTED AND OPEN IN WHAT.YOU'RE STANDING FOR TO VOTE FOR.YOU..THAT'S WHAT I DID IN.JACKSONVILLE..I WAS A NATIVE, AND I USED MY.EXPERIENCES AND MY BACKGROUND,.BUT I ALSO SHARED MY PASSION..I DIDN'T GO OUT AND SAYING THAT.I KNEW EVERYTHING, OR MAKING.PROMISE THAT'S I KNEW I.COULDN'T FULFILL..SO IF SOME OF THE PEOPLE ON THE.STAGE IN THE FEDERAL LEVEL.COULD TAKE THAT, WE WOULD BE AT.A MUCH BETTER PLACE, AND LESS.FAILED POLICIES IF PEOPLE WERE.STICK TO WHAT THEY KNOW AND SAY.I AM WILLING TO WORK ON THE.ISSUES..>>.THAT'S CHELSEA HENRY, AND.SHE APPROVES THIS IS MESSAGE..WHEN WE COME BACK, NOT HANGING.BACK OR BE CONSENTING TO.THE.GOVERNMENT, PARTICIPATION IS.WIDELY DENIGRATED..AND ARE WE MISSING SOMETHING?.ESPECIALLY MILLENNIALS WHO PUT.MORE FAITH IN THEIR FRIENDS.THAN THE INSTITUTIONS..STAY WITH US, IT'S ""INSIDE.>> THE HOMELESS, IT'S NOT ALWAYS.WHO YOU THINK..>> The majority are families.with children..>> A GROWING EPIDEMIC THAT.IMPACTS US ALL..>> I think it's the most.helpless feeling I've ever.experienced..>> BUT WHO'S GETTING RICH WHILE.SOME ARE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE?.>> They want to make the.city for people that can.afford things..>> ""FAULTLINES""..>> AL JAZEERA AMERICA'S.HARD-HITTING....>> Today the WILL be arrested..>> GROUND-BREAKING....>> They're firing canisters of.gas at us..>> AWARD-WINNING,.INVESTIGATIVE DOCUMENTARY.SERIES..>>  WELCOME BACK TO ""INSIDE.STORY,"" I'M RAY.SUAREZ..LATE TO THE PARTY..MILLENNIALS IN THE 2016 VOTE..CYCLE AFTER CYCLE, YOUNG VOTERS.HAVE BEEN PORTRAYED AS A.SLEEPING ENJOYMENT, A SECRET.WEAPON, THE ANALYST'S FONDEST.DREAMS, AND FOR A LONG TIME IN.ELECTIONS, FAILED TO LIVE UP TO.THE HYPE..BUT WAIT A MINUTE, WE'RE.TALKING.ABOUT ELECTION DAY.2016, BELIEVE ACTION IS.IMPORTANT..BUT NOT VOTE..IS NOT VOTING A POLITICAL.STATEMENT TOO?.CHELSEA HENRY IS WITH.US,.CHRISTIAN.WILSO WILL AND TRISTEN,.TAKE IT AWAY..IS THAT A RESPONSIBLE CHOICE, A.LEGITIMATE CHOICE?.>> I CAN'T SAY THAT IT'S.RESPONSIBLE..I THINK.THAT THE.PARTICIPATION.IS UNIQUELY TIED TO.OUR LIFE,.AND MOCK, THAT'S HOW IT.WORKS,.BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE NOTE.THAT WHEN SUCH A LARGE SWATH.OF.PEOPLE CHOOSE NOT TO.PARTICIPATE, THERE'S SOMETHING.FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG WITH THE.SYSTEM..AND WE HAVE TO FIND BETTER WAYS.TO.ENGAGE..AND WE HAVE TO BE INNOVATIVE.AND CREATIVE IN HOW WE REACH.PEOPLE..WE OBVIOUSLY ASSUME A LOT OF.THE INFORMATION TO BE THE.OUTLET..AND WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW.TO KEEP WITH PEOPLE AS WE MOVE..I THINK THAT THIS PARTICULAR.GENERATION OF OUR.MILLENNIAL FRIENDS, WE MOVE.AROUND A LOT..SO TO SIT STILL SO YOU CAN TALK.TO US AND IS NOT THE WAY TO.HELP YOU.WIN..>>  BUT I'VE HAD YOUNG, BLACK.AND BROWN PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR.GIVE.ME A LIST OF WAYS THAT THE.SYSTEM IS BE PERCEIVED AS.FAILING, AND GETTING THEM TO.THINK OF THEMSELVES AS A VOTER,.AS.PARTICIPANT IN THE PROCESS.OF THE ELECTORAL SENSE IS A.TOUGH SELL..>> IT IS A TOUGH SELL..BUT WITH NOTHING, IF YOU'RE.RUNNING AN ISSUE CAMPAIGN, YOU.HAVE TO TALK TO YOUR.CONSTITUENCIES ABOUT THEIR.VALUES, AND WE HAVEN'T TALKED A.LOT ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN.OUR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS..BUT THERE ARE OTHERS DOING IT.BETTER THAN OTHERS,.ARTICULATING YOUR VALUE IN THIS.PROCESS..AND IT'S AWAKENING PEOPLE..TRYING FIG OUT WELL, ALL OF THE.SENSE.OF.DISENFRANCHISEMENT,.PERHAPSING THIS SOMETHING THAT.I CAN SUPPORT THAT INCLUDES ME.FOR ONCE, AND THAT'S CRITICAL..PARTICULARLY AS WE TRY TO.IMPROVE ON THE.SUCCESSES OF OUR.ADMINISTRATION AND JOBS AND.ECONOMY..>> CHELSEA.HENRY, THEY SAY THAT.PEOPLE OF THAT AGE ARE HITTING.MILESTONES LATER, AND GETTING.MARRIED LATER, TAKING.LONGER TO.FINISH COLLEGE, AND BUYING.THEIR FIRST HOUSE OLDER, AND.COULD IT BE THAT THEY ARE.STARTING TO BE VOTERSER LATER?.THAT THEY WILL EDGE INTO VOTING.HABITS THE WAY THAT OLDER.GENERATIONS DID, BUT AT A HAD.SLIGHTLY OLDER AGE?.>> I HOPE THAT'S NOT THE CASE,.BECAUSE AS MILLENNIALS, THERE.ARE 83 MILLENNIALS IN THE.COUNTRY, AND.IN 2020, WE'RE.PROJECTED TO.BE THE LECTORATE..AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO.CAST BALLOT..I RAN FOR OFFICE WHEN I WAS 22,.AND I ENCOURAGE YOUNG PEOPLE.ALL THE TIME WHO FEEL LIKE THE.SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING FOR THEM,.TO GO OUT AND GET INVOLVED AND.RUN SOMEONE ELSE'S CAMPAIGN..THE THING THAT WE'RE IN IT.DANGER..BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO POLITICAL.PARTIES, AND BECAUSE WASHINGTON.D.C.

UNLESS ONE THING.HAPPENS, MEGYN, THERE IS A.PERSON WHO HAS THE POWER TO.RELEASE ALL THE DOCUMENTS, AND.THAT IS PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA..HE HOLDS THE POWER TO.DECLASSIFY..SO IF HILLARY CLINTON IS RIGHT,.AND IF THE WHITE HOUSE DECIDES.TO HELP THE FBI INVESTIGATION.ALONG AND PUT ITS THUMB ON THE.SCALE OF JUSTICE FOR HILLARY.CLINTON, THEN HE CAN RELEASE ALL.THE DOCUMENTS SHE JUST RELEASED,.BUT I BET HE WON'T..>> CATHERINE IS REPORTING SOME.OF THESE DOCUMENTS HAVE HUMAN.SPYING INTELLIGENCE IN THEM..WHY WOULD WE RELEASE THOSE?.>> THAT'S RIGHT..THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY, I.THINK THAT JOSH

ARE TURNING EVERYTHING.UPSIDE DOWN..IT IS INCREDIBLE..>> BUT THAT WAS CRUZ HITTING.RUBIO FOR ONCE SUPPORTING --.SAYING HE WOULDN'T SUPPORT.AMNESTY AND THEN DOING SO..>> RIGHT..WHAT KILLS ME IS, RUBIO IS.BASICALLY SAYING HOW DARE YOU DO.WHAT -- BASICALLY WHAT I DID..AND HE'S TURNING HIS RECORD.UPSIDE DOWN AND INSIDE OUT, WHEN.CRUZ IS VERY CLEAR..THE ONE THING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT.TED CRUZ IS HE IS CONSISTENT..WHY DO THEY SAY NOBODY IN THE.ESTABLISHMENT LIKES HIM?.BECAUSE HE'S CONSISTENT..HE DOES EXACTLY WHAT HE SAYS.HE'S GOING TO DO, AND HE DOESN'T.WAVER FROM THAT..THAT'S WHY THEY HIT HIM..>> I WENT BACK AND I DID TAKE A.DEEP DIVE, MUCH DEEPER THAN I.CARED TO DO, ABOUT SENATOR.CRUZ'S POSITION ON IMMIGRATION..I WAS OPEN MINDED..WHAT ARE THE FACTS AND DID HE.SUPPORT LEGALIZATION AND NOW.HE'S TRYING TO BACK OFF OF IT?.BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I'LL GO.WITH MY QUESTION OR WAS IT A.POISON PILL AND ALL THE.RHETORIC..I THINK THE RECORD IS PRETTY.CLEAR..TED CRUZ DID NOT WANT.LEGALIZATION OR AMNESTY

ILLEGAL TO BELIEVE.AS THE RADICAL MUSLIMS BELIEVE..WHAT'S ILLEGAL IS THEN TO TURN.IT INTO TERRORIST ACTS..YOU CAN'T JUST SHUT DOWN A DINER.BECAUSE MUSLIMS ARE BEING.RADICALIZED IN IT UNDER THE.FIRST

DETAILS OF.HIS PLAN TO BUILD A WALL ALONG.AMERICA'S SOUTHERN BORDER..>>> AND CITIZEN CRUZ..DONALD TRUMP IS DUSTING OFF THE.SO-CALLED BIRTHER ARGUMENT.AGAINST HIS LEADING RIVAL..BUT TED CRUZ SAYS THE FACT THAT.HE WAS BORN IN CANADA TO AN.AMERICAN MOTHER DOES NOT.DISQUALIFY HIM FROM THE.PRESIDENCY..ARE THEY HEADED FOR A SHOWDOWN?.I'M WOLF BLITZER, YOU'RE IN ""THE.SITUATION ROOM""..>>> THIS IS CNN BREAKING NEWS..>> THE BREAKING NEWS IN THIS.EARTH SHAKING ANNOUNCEMENT FROM.NORTH KOREA THAT IT'S TESTED A.HYDROGEN BOMB POTENTIALLY.HUNDREDS OF TIMES MORE POWERFUL.THAN THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS IT'S.TESTED BEFORE..EARTH DID SHAKE..SEISMIC MONITORS PICKED UP CLEAR.INDICATIONS OF A MASSIVE.UNDERGROUND EXPLOSION, BUT THE.WHITE HOUSE CALLS THE DATA.INCONSISTENT WITH THE H-BOMB.CLAIM..STILL, THERE'S A CHORUS OF.CONDEMNATION FROM AROUND THE.WORLD, URGE AT THE UNITED.NATIONS AND PUSH FOR NEW TOUGH.SANCTIONS ON KIM JONG-UN'S.REGIME..>>> IN AN INTERVIEW WITH DONALD.TRUMP, I ASKED IF HE'D LAUNCH A.PREEMPTIVE STRIKE OR REMOVE.TROOPS FROM THE PENINSULA..WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND.GUN CONTROL..AND HEAR WHAT THE GOP.FRONT-RUNNER HAS TO SAY ABOUT.RIVALS INCLUDING HIS HINTS TED.CRUZ MAY NOT EVEN BE QUALIFIED.TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, THAT HE.MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE A NATURAL.BORN CITIZEN..>> I HOPE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN..AND HE'S GOT THIS CLOUD OVER HIS.HEAD, I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING.TO BE POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DO.VERY WELL..>> I'LL SPEAK WITH RANKING.DEMOCRAT ON THE HOUSE INTENTION.COMMITTEE CONGRESSMAN ADAM.SCHIFF, AND OUR CORRESPONDENTS,.ANALYSTS AND GUESTS WILL HAVE.FULL COVERAGE OF ALL THE DAY'S.TOP STORIES..BUT LET'S BEGIN WITH NORTH.KOREA'S STUNNING CLAIM THAT IT'S.TESTED A HYDROGEN BOMB THAT'S.BRINGING WORLDWIDE CONDEMNATION.AND A THREAT OF PUNISHMENT..LET'S GO TO CNN'S BRIAN TODD..BRIAN, THERE'S A LOT OF.SKEPTICISM ABOUT THIS CLAIM..BUT EVEN IF IT'S A NORMAL.NUCLEAR TEST, WHY WOULD KIM.JONG-UN TAKE SUCH A DANGEROUS.STEP RIGHT NOW?.>> WOLF, THAT IS WHAT.INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES FROM.WASHINGTON TO SEOUL, TOKYO,.BEIJING ARE ALL SCRAMBLING TO.FIND OUT TONIGHT..ANALYSTS ARE TELLING US THE.NORTH KOREANS LIKELY DID THIS.NOW BECAUSE THEY PROBABLY JUST.CLEARED SOME TECHNICAL HURDLES..BUT KIM JONG-UN IS ALSO TRYING.TO FEND OFF SOME VERY POWERFUL.EXTERNAL AND POTENTIALLY.INTERNAL RIVALS..AND EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT'S WHY.THIS VIOLENT, UNPREDICTABLE.YOUNG LEADER TOOK THIS VERY.DANGEROUS STEP..WITH AN EXPLOSION THE SIZE OF A.MODERATE EARTHQUAKE AND THE.UNCONTAINABLE GLEE OF A STATE.NEWS ANCHOR, KIM JONG-UN MAKES.HIS RIVALS SHUDDER AND SENDS.INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES.SCRAMBLING..A SENIOR U.S. OFFICIAL TELLS CNN.NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR TEST,.WHETHER IT'S A HYDROGEN BOMB OR.NOT, IS VERY CONCERNING..ANALYSTS GIVE A STARK ASSESSMENT.OF THE DANGER..>> NORTH KOREA'S MOVING EVER.CLOSER TO A DELIVERABLE NUCLEAR.WARHEAD THAT IS MINIATURIZED,.THAT CAN HIT JAPAN, GUAM,.PERHAPS HAWAII OR THE WEST.COAST, THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE.MOVING AND THEY'RE DOING IT WITH.IMPUNITY.IMPUNITY..>> Reporter: FROM SEOUL TO.WASHINGTON OFFICIALS ARE AS.ASSESSING KIM'S MOTIVES..ONE POSSIBILITY HE'S SIGNALING.HIS ENEMIES WHO HE SEES.EVERYWHERE..>> KIM JONG-UN IS FACING THREATS.FROM ALL FRONTS..DOMESTICALLY, INTERNALLY FROM.HIS ELITES AND SO HE HAS TO BE.ABLE TO MANAGE AND CONTROL ALL.OF THAT INTERNALLY..BUT OF COURSE THERE'S ALWAYS THE.THREAT THAT NORTH KOREA BELIEVES.COMES FROM ITS EXTERNAL.ENVIRONMENT..>> EXTERNAL RIVALS LIKE SOUTH.KOREA AND THE U.S..KIM CAN'T COMPETE WITH THEM WITH.HIS MILITARY AND NEEDS NUCLEAR.WEAPONS TO BALANCE THE FIELD..BUT HE'S GOT ANOTHER POSSIBLE.MOTIVE WITH HIS OUTSIDE RIVALS..>> WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS THEY CAN.BLACKMAIL, INTIMIDATE AND.THREATEN THE UNITED STATES,.JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, CHINA, TO.GET ECONOMIC AID, SANCTIONS.RELIEF AND OTHER THINGS TO.PRESERVE THEIR REGIME..>> A U.S. OFFICIAL SAYS THIS.TEST COULD BE AN IMPORTANT RAMP.UP TO THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED.CONGRESS OF THE KOREAN WORKERS.PARTY IN MAY..NORTH KOREA HASN'T HELD SUCH AN.EVENT FOR 36 YEARS..AND AT THAT GATHERING OF THE.ELITES, KIM IS EXPECTED TO.CONSOLIDATE HIS RULE, SHIFT MORE.POWER FROM THE MILITARY TO.HIMSELF..EXPERTS BELIEVE KIM'S FLEXING.HIS NUCLEAR MUSCLES NOW BECAUSE.THE INTERNAL THREATS HE FACES.ARE CONSTANT..>> HE HAS TO BE MORE FEARFUL.EVERY MORNING HE WAKES UP THAT.HE WON'T GET A BULLET IN HIS.HEAD..THERE ARE GENERAL OFFICERS.INSIDE NORTH KOREA WHO CAN'T.MOBILIZE AGAINST HIM, BUT IF.THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO THAT.I CAN HIM OUT IN THE FUTURE, I.THINK HE CAN'T REST PEACEFULLY.ABOUT THAT..>> NOW, A KEY QUESTION TONIGHT,.IF KIM FINALLY DEVELOPS A.DELIVERABLE NUCLEAR WEAPON, IS.HE DANGEROUS ENOUGH, UNSTABLE.ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY USE IT?.MOST ANALYSTS BELIEVE HE WOULD.NOT LAUNCH A NUCLEAR WEAPON JUST.TO PROVOKE, BUT HE COULD DO IT.IF HE'S DESPERATE OR IF THERE'S.ANOTHER STANDOFF LIKE THE ONE HE.HAD WITH SOUTH KOREA LAST.SUMMER, HE COULD MISCALCULATE IN.AN INSTANCE LIKE THAT, WOLF..THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE SITUATION.SO VERY DANGEROUS TONIGHT..>> BRIAN, WHAT WOULD MAKE A.HYDROGEN BOMB IN THE HANDS OF.THE NORTH KOREANS A LOT MORE.DANGEROUS THAN AN ATOMIC BOMB?.>> HYDROGEN BOMBS, WOLF, ARE.MUCH MORE POWERFUL..PERSPECTIVE BOMBS DROPPED ON.HIROSHIMA AND NAGASAKI IN 1945.KILLING MORE THAN 200,000.PEOPLE, EACH OF THOSE BOMBS.PRODUCED THE EQUIVALENT OF.13,000 TONS OF TNT, THE FIRST.HYDROGEN BOMB TESTS IN THE 1950s.WAS 700 TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN.THAT..ATOMIC BOMBS USE FISSION.SPLITTING PLUTONIUM INTO SMALLER.ATOMS, HYDROGEN BOMBS USE FUSION.COMBINING ATOMS CREATING TWO.BOMBS IN ONE..EXPERTS BELIEVE NORTH KOREA IS.LIKELY GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN.FIVE YEARS TO PRODUCE A HYDROGEN.BOMB, BUT THE KEY THING, WOLF,.THEY HAVE THE DESIRE, THE.TECHNOLOGY, THEY ARE WORKING ON.IT..THEY CAN GET THERE..>> THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITY..BRIAN, THANK YOU..CNN'S WILL RIPLEY HAS BEEN.INSIDE NORTH KOREA NOW A NUMBER.OF TIMES..HE JOINS US LIVE FROM BEIJING..WILL, WILL CHINA, OBVIOUSLY A.CLEAR NEIGHBOR, SOMETHING OF A.FRIEND TO NORTH KOREA WITH A LOT.OF INFLUENCE OVER THERE, WHAT'S.BEEN THE REACTION SO FAR IN.CHINA?.>> WELL, CLIE NA CERTAINLY.STRONGLY CONDEMNING THIS ACTION,.WOLF, JUST LIKE SO MANY OTHER.COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, BUT.UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS NUCLEAR TEST.IN IN2009.ADERS HERE IN BEIJING ARE.CALLING FOR HIGH LEVEL MEETINGS..BUT STOPPING SHORT, WOLF, OF.SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO PENALIZE.THE REGIME LED BY KIM JONG-UN..>> WILL, YOU'VE MADE SEVERAL.TRIPS TO PYONGYANG AND NORTH.KOREA..WHY WOULD THE REGIME THERE CLAIM.A HYDROGEN BOMB TEST?.>> WELL, BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS.TWO NUCLEAR TESTS DURING THE.OBAMA ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T GET.A REACTION FROM THE UNITED.STATES..THIS POLICY OF STRATEGIC.PATIENCE IS INFURIATING TO THE.NORTH KOREANS WHO WANT NOTHING.MORE THAN TO SIT DOWN WITH THE.UNITED STATES AND TALK ABOUT.LIFTING SANCTIONS AND.NORMALIZING RELATIONS..SO BY CLAIMING THEY HAVE AN.H-BOMB AT A TIME WHEN KIM.JONG-UN JUST GAVE A NEW YEAR.ADDRESS TALKING ABOUT WANTING TO.GROW THE ECONOMY..CLEARLY THEY'RE HOPING THIS WILL.GIVE THEM SOME LEVERAGE TO FORCE.THE WORLD LED BY THE U.S. TO SIT.DOWN WITH THE NORTH KOREANS AND.TALK TO THEM AS THEY WOULD WITH.OTHER COUNTRIES..THAT'S SOMETHING THE NORTH.KOREANS WOULD DESPERATELY WANT..IT'S ALSO NOTEWORTHY IT'S TWO.DAYS BEFORE KIM JONG-UN'S 33rd.BIRTHDAY..33 YEARS OLD..AND REALLY WITH HIS FINGER AT.THE BUTTON OF A GROWING NUCLEAR.ARSENAL IN A COUNTRY WITH A LOT.OF RAW URANIUM A VERY TROUBLING.DEVELOPMENT FOR THE WORLD THAT.THIS NUCLEAR PROGRAM CONTINUES.TO DEVELOP..IN SPITE OF ALL THE SANCTIONS,.UNCHECKED, WOLF..>> TO PUT IT MILDLY..ALL RIGHT, WILL, THANK YOU VERY.MUCH..WILL RIPLEY IN BEIJING..WHILE NORTH KOREA'S CLAIM OF AN.H-BOMB TEST SENT SHOCK WAVES.AROUND THE WORLD, THE UNITED.STATES AND OTHER NATIONS ARE.MAKING IT CLEAR THAT ANY OTHER.KIND OF NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR.TEST IS UNACCEPTABLE..LET'S GO TO ELISE LABOTT..ELISE, HAS KIM JONG-UN THIS TIME.GONE TOO FAR?.>> WELL, WOLF, EVEN AS IT POURED.WATER ON NORTH KOREA'S CLAIMS IT.TESTED A HYDROGEN BOMB, THE U.S..ASKED THE U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL.TO CONSIDER NEW SANCTIONS..IT'S ALL PART OF THE OBAMA.ADMINISTRATION'S POLICY TOWARDS.NORTH KOREA DUBBED STRATEGIC.PATIENCE..BUT AFTER FOUR NUCLEAR TESTS.THERE ARE QUESTIONS TONIGHT.ABOUT WHETHER THAT POLICY HAS.HELPED THE NORTH KOREAN NUCLEAR.PROGRAM GROW..NORTH KOREA'S CLAIM THAT IT.TESTED A HYDROGEN BOMB SHOCKED.THE WORLD..>> Translator: NORTH KOREA'S.NUCLEAR TEST IS A SERIOUS THREAT.TO OUR NATION'S SECURITY AND.ABSOLUTELY CANNOT BE TOLERATED..>> Reporter: EVEN CHINA, NORTH.KOREA'S NEIGHBOR AND CLOSEST.ALLY, QUICKLY DENOUNCED THE TEST.AFTER DOWNPLAYING THE NUCLEAR.THREAT FOR YEARS, GROWING.CONCERN IN BEIJING OVER THE.PROGRAM UNDER NORTH KOREA'S.ERRATIC AND UNPREDICTABLE.LEADER..U.S. OFFICIALS HOPE NORTH.KOREA'S LARGEST BENEFACTOR WILL.FINALLY PUT THE SQUEEZE ON KIM.JONG-UN..AND WANTS THE U.N. SECURITY.COUNCIL TO IMPOSE TOUGH NEW.SANCTIONS..>> WHAT WE DO WANT TO SEE IS A.STRONG INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE TO.THIS LATEST PROVOCATION..AND EWE EWE ANONYMITY..>> Reporter: BUT DECADES OF.SANCTIONS HAVE FAILED TO CURB.THE NUCLEAR AMBITIONS OF THREE.GENERATIONS OF NORTH KOREAN.LEADERS..THE NORTH GIVEN DIPLOMATIC COVER.TO BUILD A NUCLEAR WEAPON..PRESIDENT BUSH CAME CLOSE TO A.DEAL WHERE PYONGYANG WOULD TRADE.ITS NUKES FOR AID IN A PEACE.TREATY, BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN..PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME TO OFFICE.PROMISING NOT TO OVERREACT TO.NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR ANTICS,.CONTINUING SANCTIONS UNTIL.PYONGYANG AGREED TO NEGOTIATE AN.END TO ITS PROGRAM..INSTEAD THE U.S. FOCUSED ON A.NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN, A MORE.WILLING PARTNER..IN APRIL IRAN AGREED TO ROBUST.CURBS ON ITS PROGRAM..MEANWHILE, THREE OF NORTH.KOREA'S FOUR NUCLEAR TESTS HAVE.BEEN LAUNCHED SINCE OBAMA TOOK.OFFICE..CRITICS LABEL OBAMA'S SO-CALLED.STRATEGIC PATIENCE A RECIPE FOR.DIPLOMATIC FAILURE..>> SOME NEW DIPLOMATIC POLICY.OPTIONS NEED TO BE PUT ON THE.TABLE..AND MY VIEW IS THAT A DEAL LIKE.IRAN'S SIMILAR LIKE WE HAD.BEFORE IN THE.T IS READY TO.TALK..AND THAT'S WHY, WOLF, IT'S.UNCLEAR WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO.BRING THEM TO THE TABLE..FOR STARTERS, THE NORTH HAS.DEMANDED TO BE OFFICIALLYMONHS T.N.E.DEMILITARIZED ZONE, ALMOST A.MILLION SOUTH KOREAN TROOPS.SOUTH OF THEUC DEMILITARIZED ZO..>> AND WE HAVE 2800DIERS.IN THE MIDDLE..AND WE GET PAID PEANUTS..>> WOULD YOU PULL THEM OUT?.>> WELL, I WOULD WANT SOUTH.KOREA TO PAY US A LOT OF MONEY..WE'RE DOING A LOT OF -- WHAT ARE.WE DOING?.I JUST ORDERED 4,000 TELEVISION.SETS..THEY COME FROM SOUTH KOREA..SOUTH KOREA IS A MONEY MACHINE..THEY PAY US PEANUTS..WE'RE DEFENDING THEM, AND I HAVE.MANY FRIENDS FROM SOUTH KOREA,.THEY BUY MY APARTMENTS, I DO.BUSINESS WITH THEM..BUT SOUTH KOREA SHOULD PAY US.AND PAY US VERY SUBSTANTIALLY.FOR PROTECTING THEM..>> SO YOU WANT CHINA BASICALLY.TO HANDLE THE NORTH KOREA.PROBLEM..>> THEY CAN HANDLE THEM SO.EASILY..NOW, THEY DON'T SAY THAT..THEY SAY, WELL, THEY'RE NOT THAT.EASY, THEY'RE NOT THAT EASY..THEY'RE TAUNTING US, OKAY..THEY'RE PLAYING GAMES WITH US..I DO IT ALL THE TIME..THAT'S THE WAY I DEAL IN.BUSINESS..THEY'RE PLAYING GAMES WITH US..CHINA SHOULD SOLVE THAT PROBLEM..AND IF THEY DON'T SOLVE THAT.PROBLEM, WE SHOULD BE VERY TOUGH.ON THEM WITH TRADE..MEANING START CHARGING THEM TAX.OR START CUTTING THEM OFF..YOU'D HAVE CHINA COLLAPSE IN.ABOUT TWO MINUTES..>> I'VE HEARD --.>> WE HAVE GREAT POWER OVER.CHINA, WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO.USE IT..>> ALL RIGHT..THE FULL INTERVIEW WITH DONALD.TRUMP COMING UP LATER HERE IN.""THE SITUATION ROOM."".BUT RIGHT NOW I WANT TO BRING IN.THE RANKING MEMBER OF THE HOUSE.INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE,.DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ADAM.SCHIFF OF CALIFORNIA..CONGRESSMAN, STHANKS FOR JOINING.US..I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WELL BRIEFED.ON WHAT'S GOING ON..ARE NORTH KOREA'S CLAIMS TO BE.BELIEVED?.>> WELL, I SHARE THE SKEPTICISM.THAT WAS EXPRESSED TODAY BY THE.ADMINISTRATION GIVEN THE PUBLIC.DATA ABOUT THE SIZE OF THAT.SEISMIC MOVEMENT FOLLOWING THE.EXPLOSION..WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THOUGH,.BUT I THINK WE'LL KNOW FAIRLY.SOON AND THAT WILL GIVE US GOOD.INSIGHT INTO JUST WHAT KIND OF A.BOMB THIS WAS..DID THEY USE TRITIUM TO TRY TO.ENHANCE THE POWER OF A FISSION.BOMB OR WAS THIS A HYDROGEN BOMB.AS THEY CLAIM?.BUT I WOULD TAKE NORTH KOREAN.CLAIMS WITH A VERY BIG GRAIN OF.SALT..>> DID THE U.S. HAVE ANY ADVANCE.INTELLIGENCE WARNING OF THE.TIMING OF THIS NUCLEAR TEST?.>> WOLF, I CAN'T GO INTO THE.SPECIFICS OF THAT OF WHAT, YOU.KNOW, WE SOERVE OR WHAT WE MAY.HAVE SEEN..I CAN TELL YOU THIS IS SOMETHING.OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR.INTELLIGENCE ASSETS DIRECTED TO.DETERMINE THAT IS WHAT'S.HAPPENING IN NORTH KOREA'S.MISSILE PROGRAM, WHAT'S.HAPPENING IN THEIR NUCLEAR.PROGRAM, WHEN ARE THEY LIKELY TO.LAUNCH MISSILES, WHEN ARE THEY.LIKELY TO INITIATE NUCLEAR.TESTS..THIS IS SOMETHING WE KEEP A VERY.CLOSE EYE ON..>> YOU SAY THERE SHOULD BE MORE.ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON NORTH.KOREA..THERE ALREADY ARE A TON OF.SANCTIONS..AND SO FAR THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY.MUCH INEFFECTIVE..WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO GET THE JOB.DONE TO STOP NORTH KOREA FROM.BEING A NUCLEAR POWER?.>> WELL, I THINK THE COUNTRY.THAT REALLY HAS THE LEVERAGE.HERE IS CHINA..AND RIGHT NOW CHINA HASN'T BEEN.WILLING TO USE THAT LEVERAGE TO.MAXIMUM EXTENT AS YOUR.COMMENTATORS WERE POINTING OUT.EARLIER..CHINA IS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THESE.NORTH KOREAN TESTS, BUT AT THE.SAME TIME DOESN'T WANT THE.REGIME TO COLLAPSE, DOESN'T WANT.TO UNIFY KOREAN PENINSULA ALLY.TO THE WEST RIGHT ON ITS BORDER..I THINK THE WAY TO CHANGE THE.CALCULUS FOR CHINA IS TO MAKE IT.VERY CLEAR THAT WE'RE GOING TO.HAVE TO INCREASE OUR MILITARY.PRESENCE IN THE REGION..WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE.TALKING TO OUR ALLIES IN THE.REGION ABOUT WHAT ADDITIONAL.MILITARY ASSETS TO BRING TO BEAR.TO DEFEND OURSELVES AND OUR.ALLIES FROM THIS GROWING THREAT.THAT OUR STRATEGIC PATIENCE IS.WEARING OUT..CHINA DOESN'T WANT TO SEE US DO.THAT..AND THAT MAY BE THE KIND OF.MOTIVATION CHINA NEEDS TO REALLY.CRACKDOWN ON SANCTIONS THAT HAVE.A BITE..>> CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, STANDBY.FOR A MOMENT..WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE ON.WHAT'S GOING ON IN NORTH KOREA,.ALSO THE WAR AGAINST ISIS..AND ALSO COMING UP, MY.ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEW TODAY WITH.DONALD TRUMP..YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS.TO SAY ABOUT HIS RIVALS ON THE.HOT

PLAY FOR YOU SOMETHING.THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE.UNITED STATES BILL CLINTON HAD.TO SAY ABOUT THE DEAL HE STRUCK.WITH NORTH KOREA TO END ITS.NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM BACK IN.1994..LISTEN TO THIS..>> BEFORE I TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS,.I'D LIKE TO SAY JUST A WORD.ABOUT THE FRAMEWORK WITH NORTH.KOREA THAT WAS SIGNED THIS.MORNING..THIS IS A GOOD DEAL FOR THE.UNITED STATES..NORTH KOREA WILL FREEZE AND THEN.DISMANTLE ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM..SOUTH KOREA AND OUR OTHER ALLIES.WILL BE BETTER PROTECTED..THE ENTIRE WORLD WILL BE SAFER.AS WE SLOW THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR.WEAPONS..SOUTH KOREA WITH SUPPORT FROM.JAPAN AND OTHER NATIONS WILL.BEAR MOST OF THE COST OF.PROVIDING NORTH KOREA WITH FUEL.TO MAKE UP FOR THE NUCLEAR.ENERGY IT IS LOSING..AND THEY WILL PAY FOR AN.ALTERNATIVE POWER SYSTEM FOR.NORTH KOREA THAT WILL ALLOW THEM.TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY WHILE.MAKING IT MUCH HARDER FOR THEM.TO PRODUCE NUCLEAR WEAPONS..THE UNITED STATES AND.INTERNATIONAL INSPECTORS WILL.CAREFULLY MONITOR NORTH KOREA TO.MAKE SURE IT KEEPS ITS.COMMITMENTS..ONLY AS IT DOES SO WILL NORTH.KOREA FULLY JOIN THE COMMUNITY.OF NATIONS..>> CLEARLY THAT HAS NOT WORKED.OUT, CONGRESSMAN..PRESIDENT CLINTON'S AGREED UPON.FRAMEWORK ESSENTIALLY WOUND UP.GIVING PYONGYANG DIPLOMATIC.COVER TO BUILD A NUCLEAR WEAPON.AND A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THE SAME.THING POTENTIALLY COULD HAPPEN.WITH IRAN RIGHT NOW..YOU VOTED IN FAVOR OF THAT IRAN.NUCLEAR DEAL..WAS THAT A MISTAKE?.>> NO, IT WASN'T A MISTAKE..AND WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT.KIND OF VERIFICATION REGIME WITH.IRAN..I THINK ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE.IN HISTORY TO MAKE SURE THAT.IRAN DOESN'T CHEAT THE WAY NORTH.KOREA DID BY PURSUING A.DIFFERENT PATHWAY TO THE BOMB..SO I THINK WE HAVE A VERY.DIFFERENT SITUATION IN IRAN THAN.IN NORTH KOREA..AND I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU CAN.REALLY COMPARE THE TWO VERY.WELL..>> DID THE CLINTON.ADMINISTRATION, THE BUSH.ADMINISTRATION, THE OBAMA.ADMINISTRATION DROP THE BALL AS.FAR AS NORTH KOREA AND ITS.NUCLEAR PROGRAM IS CONCERNED?.>> I DON'T THINK THEY DROPPED.THE BALL, BUT I THINK IT'S A.RECOGNITION OF A LIMITED RANGE.OF OPTIONS..OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE HEAVY.MILITARY PRESENCE ALONG THAT.DEMILITARIZED ZONE AS YOU POINT.OUT, MILITARY ACTION IS A VERY.FRAUGHT KIND OF AN OPTION..SO WHERE YOU'RE REALLY LEFT IS.WITH ECONOMIC PRESSURE OR SOME.KIND OF NEGOTIATED OUTCOME..NEGOTIATIONS DID NOT WORK..NORTH KOREA VIOLATED THE SPIRIT.IF NOT THE LETTER OF THAT.AGREEMENT..AND HERE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO.HAVE TO TRY TO ONCE AGAIN GIN UP.THE SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA,.PUT PRESSURE ON CHINA TO DO ITS.PART, BE A STRONGER ACTOR IN THE.WORLD STAGE IN DEALING WITH THIS.GROWING MENACE..AND ONE OTHER TOOL I WOULD.ENCOURAGE US TO USE MUCH MORE.EXTENSIVELY AND THAT IS WE HAVE.SEEN THE SENSITIVITY OF THE.NORTH KOREAN REGIME TO.INFORMATION DISSEMINATED TO ITS.OWN PEOPLE ABOUT THE HORRORS OF.ITS OWN REGIME..AND I WOULD USE THIS AS AN.OPPORTUNITY TO FIGHT BACK IN THE.INFORMATION WARS BY BOMBARDING.THE NORTH KOREANS WITH.INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THEIR OWN.RULER IS FEEDING THEIR NUCLEAR.PROGRAM RATHER THAN FEEDING THE.STARVING PEOPLE OF NORTH KOREA..SO I THINK WE OUGHT TO BE.AGGRESSIVE IN HITTING NORTH.KOREA WITH WHAT HURTS THEM..>> NORTH KOREA DID PROVIDE.NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY TO SYRIA..THEY BUILT A NUCLEAR REACTOR,.THE ISRAELIS DESTROYED THAT BACK.IN 2007..THEY PROVIDED NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY.TO PAKISTAN, WHICH NOW HAS A.NUCLEAR ARSENAL..IS THERE EVIDENCE RIGHT NOW.NORTH KOREA WHICH IS HARD.PRESSED FOR CASH IS ABOUT TO.SELL NUCLEAR RELATED TECHNOLOGY.TO OTHERS?.>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S.EVIDENCE THAT THEY'RE ON THE.CUSP OF DOING SO, BUT I.CERTAINLY WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST.THEM..AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE.WATCH VIGILANT LY..THE ONLY LINKAGE I WOULD SAY,.WOLF, BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND.IRAN IS THE AGREEMENT WITH IRAN.I THINK BECAUSE OF THE VIGOROUS.INSPECTION REGIME PRETTY WELL.CUTS OFF IRAN'S PATHWAY TO A.BOMB THROUGH THE CLANDESTINE.ENRICHMENT CAPABILITY..IF I WERE IRAN AND WANTED TO.CHEAT TO MAKE A BOMB, I WOULD.BUY IT ELSEWHERE..AND HERE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO.REALLY WATCH NORTH KOREA AND.MAKE SURE THAT IRAN DOESN'T SEEK.TO CHEAT BY GOING TO A COUNTRY.LIKE NORTH KOREA TO GET THE.FINISHED PRODUCT..>> CONGRESSMAN SCHIFF, THANKS.VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US..>> THANKS, WOLF..>>> TODAY'S BREAKING POLITICAL.NEWS, I ASKED THE REPUBLICAN.PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER,.DONALD TRUMP, ABOUT

ONE.THING, YOU CAN'T HAVE SOMEBODY.RUNNING IF THE DEMOCRATS ARE.GOING TO AT SOME POINT AND ONE.OF THEM THREATENED TO BRING A.SUIT A LONG TIME AGO..BUT HOW CAN YOU HAVE A NOMINEE.RUNNING, YOU KNOW, AGAINST A.DEMOCRAT WHOEVER IT MAY BE,.PROBABLY HILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE.SHE'LL PROBABLY ESCAPE THE.E-MAIL PROBLEM, WHICH IS.DISGUSTING THAT SHE'S ABLE TO..BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE DOING.FAR LESS HAVE

THE.UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THE.UNITED STATES, 11 MILLION OR 12.MILLION, AS MANY AS THERE ARE,.BUT THE GOOD ONES YOU SAY CAN.COME BACK TO THE UNITED STATES..HE SAYS HE'S NOT LETTING ANY OF.THE IMMIGRANTS COME BACK TO THE.UNITED STATES..>> TED WAS IN FAVOR OF AMNESTY..HIM AND MARCO RUBIO HAVE BEEN.FIGHTING ABOUT WHO'S WEAKER..NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN -- AND I WAS.WATCHING TED THE OTHER DAY..IT WAS VERY INTERESTING..HE SAID, AND WE MUST BUILD A.WALL..AND MY WIFE SAID, DARLING, HE.JUST SAID BUILD A WALL..THAT'S THE FIRST PERSON, I'VE.BEEN SAYING IT FOR FIVE YEARS..BUT HE SAID, AND WE WILL BUILD A.WALL..SO NOW HE'S TAKING MY IDEA FOR.THE WALL..I'M GLAD HE'S TAKING IT..I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO.DO..THE PROBLEM IS I'LL BUILD THE.WALL, IT WILL BE THE RIGHT WALL,.M.THESE POLITICIANS DON'T KNOW HOW.TO BUILD A WALL, THEY DON'T KNOW.HOW TO BUILD ANYTHING, BUT I'LL.BUILD A WALL AND HAVE MEXICO PAY.FOR IT..BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE.TRYING TO COME INTO MY.TERRITORY..NO, WE WILL GET PEOPLE OUT..AND THE PEOPLE THAT COME BACK.WILL COME BACK LEGALLY..THEY WILL COME BACK LEGALLY..WE'LL HAVE A COUNTRY AGAIN..WE'RE GOING TO HAVE STRONG.BORDERS..BORDER PATROL PEOPLE ARE.FANTASTIC..I GOT TO KNOW THEM VERY WELL,.BUT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A WALL..NOW, I HEARD JUST THE OTHER DAY.TED SAID HE NEVER SAID ABOUT.WALL BEFORE..ALL OF A SUDDEN HE'S TALKING.ABOUT WALL..AND I DON'T BLAME HIM..>> HE SAYS HE'S NOT GOING TO LET.ANY OF THOSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS.COME BACK TO THE UNITED STATES..>> WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD LET.THEM COME BACK IF THEY'RE VERY.GOOD PEOPLE YOU LET THEM COME.BACK LEGALLY..I'M BUILDING A WALL, BUT I WANT.PEOPLE TO COME IN..I WANT IMMIGRANTS TO COME IN,.BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN.LEGALLY..AND I WANT A LOT OF PEOPLE TO.COME IN..I WANT TO HAVE REALLY SMART.PEOPLE, REALLY GOOD PEOPLE,.REALLY HARD WORKERS COME BACK.IN..BUT THEY HAVE TO COME IN.LEGALLY..SO I WANT PEOPLE TO COME BACK.INTO THE COUNTRY..>> LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.THE WALL YOU WANT TO BUILD..HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO BUILD.THAT WALL?.>> VERY QUICKLY..>> HOW LONG?.>> I WOULD GET THE ENVIRONMENTAL.IMPACTS -- YOU KNOW, PART OF THE.REASON THE WALL WASN'T BUILT.THEY COULDN'T GET AN.ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT.APPROVED..CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?.THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.STATEMENT FOR A WALL WHERE WE'RE.LOOKING FOR -- YOU COULD ALMOST.SAY MILITARY PURPOSES..AND THAT WAY YOU AVOID IT..AS AN EXAMPLE, IN THE SOUTH.CHINA SEA, CHINA IS BUILDING.ISLANDS..MASSIVE ISLANDS THAT ARE BEING,.YOU KNOW, MILITARY BASES..THEY'RE TAKING OUT AND THEY'RE.DREDGING THE SEA..THEY'RE DREDGING THE OCEAN..>> ARE YOU SAYING MEXICO'S GOING.TO PAY FOR THE WALL..ARE THEY GOING TO PUT THE MONEY.UP FRONT OR HOW DO YOU DO THAT?.>> THEY'LL PAY IN ONE OF THREE.OR FOUR DIFFERENT WAYS INCLUDING.I'LL CHARGE THEM A TARIFF..I'M FRIENDLY WITH MEXICO..I EMPLOY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE,.MEXICANS ARE GREAT PEOPLE..THEY LIKE ME..I'M DOING VERY WELL BY THE WAY.WITH THE HISPANICS..YOU SAW IN NEVADA I'M LEADING IN.THE POLLS WITH HISPANICS BECAUSE.I CREATE JOBS..HERE'S THE THING, MEXICO'S.MAKING A FORTUNE..YOU LOOK AT THE TRADE DEFICIT.THAT WE HAVE WITH MEXICO,.THEY'RE MAKING A FORTUNE..FORD'S GOING TO BUILD A $2.5.BILLION PLANT IN NEW MEXICO..NA BIS COIS MOVING THEIR BIG.FLANT --.>> HOW DO YOU GET MEXICO TO PAY.FOR A WALL?.>> SIMPLE..>> THEY SAY THEY WON'T..>> THAT'S GOOD..THEN WE'LL TAX THEIR GOODS COME.SBOOG THIS COUNTRY AND THEY'LL.PAY..THE WALL IS PEANUTS COMPARED TO.THE KIND OF MONEY THEY'RE.MAKING..THAT'S WHY THEY'RE GOING TO PAY..WHEN I SAY THAT TO POLITICIANS,.THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING.ABOUT..I'M A BUSINESS GUY..I'M A REALLY GOOD BUSINESS GUY..WHEN I SAY TO POLITICIANS.MEXICANS ARE GOING TO PAY FOR.THE WALL, THEY ALL SMILE..THE REASON THEY'RE GOING TO PAY.IS THEY'RE MAKING A FORTUNE OF.THE UNITED STATES FAR MORE THAN.THE COST OF THE WALL..THEY'LL PAY..>> WE'RE ONLY GETTING STARTED.WITH DONALD TRUMP..WE HAVE MUCH MORE COMING UP FROM.MY EXTENSIVE ONE-ON-ONE.INTERVIEW WITH

PROBLEM OF.NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS..MORE ON THE INTERVIEW COMING UP,.BUT LET'S GET SOME INSIGHT WHAT.WE'VE JUST HEARD..JOINING US OUR CNN POLITICAL.REPORTER SARA MURRAY COVERED.DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE'S ON THE.ROAD..OUR SENIOR WASHINGTON.CORRESPONDENT JEFF ZELENY AND.OUR CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST.GLORIA BORGER..GLORIA, I ASKED TRUMP WHETHER HE.BELIEVES SENATOR TED CRUZ IS A.NATURAL BORN CITIZEN, HE TOLD ME.HE DOESN'T KNOW..WHAT'S GOING ON OVER HERE?.WHY IS HE DOING THIS?.>> WOLF, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF.THE TECHNICAL TERM CALLED POT.STIRRING?.BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT.DONALD TRUMP IS DOING..OBVIOUSLY TED CRUZ IS NOW AHEAD.OF HIM IN IOWA..HE KEEPS PROTESTING, YOU KNOW, I.LIKE TED A LOT, I'D LIKE TO SEE.HIM GET THIS ISSUE SETTLED..BUT IN CONTINUING TO TALK ABOUT.THIS ISSUE AND SAY THAT IT IS.NOT SETTLED LAW, WHICH BY THE.WAY MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IT.IS, IF YOU'LL RECALL JOHN McCAIN.WAS BORN IN PANAMA AND THAT.DIDN'T SEEM TO BE MUCH OF AN.ISSUE THEN..BY SAYING THAT HE'S GOT TO.SETTLE THIS ISSUE HE IS IMPLYING.OF COURSE THAT IT IS NOT A.SETTLED ISSUE..AND WE'VE HEARD TED CRUZ SAY.TODAY TO DANA BASH THAT IT IS A.SETTLED ISSUE..SO HE'S JUST CLEARLY TRYING TO.RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT CRUZ..>> WHAT HE AND HIS SUPPORTERS.POINT OUT, JEFF ZELENY, IS THAT.JOHN McCAIN WAS BORN ON A U.S..MILITARY BASE IN THE PANAMA.CANAL ZONE, WHICH IS DIFFERENT.THAN SIMPLY BEING BORN IN PANAMA.IF YOU WILL..BUT WHY DO YOU THINK, JEFF,.DONALD TRUMP IS DOING THIS NOW?.>> IT'S BECAUSE THOSE IOWA.CAUCUSES, WOLF, ARE 26 DAYS.AWAY..AND TED CRUZ IS COMING ON STRONG.THERE..I AM STRUCK BY ALL OUR TRIPS TO.IOWA..I JUST GOT BACK FROM THERE A.COUPLE HOURS AGO TALKING TO.REPUBLICAN VOTERS..THERE ARE SO MANY WHO ARE.DECIDING TED CRUZ OR DONALD.TRUMP..YOU KNOW, THEY'VE LIKED DONALD.TRUMP SORT OF A STRONG.ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT VIEWS, BUT.NOW THEY ARE SORT OF BECOMING.MORE SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR.SPECIFIC ISSUES THAT EACH OF.THESE CANDIDATES HOLD..SO I THINK DONALD TRUMP REALIZES.THAT TED CRUZ IS TAKING SOME OF.HIS SUPPORTERS AWAY..I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS AS.GLORIA SAID TRYING TO STIR THE.POT HERE..I'M NOT SURE IF IT WORKS,.BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SOUND.CREDIBLE..HIS MOTHER WAS A UNITED STATES.CITIZEN HERE, I DON'T THINK ON.THE MARGINS PERHAPS IF SOMEONE.IS NOT SURE ABOUT TED CRUZ BUT I.THINK WHAT IT DOES MORE THAN.ANYTHING IT GETS DONALD TRUMP.SOME MORE ATTENTION AND GIVES.MORE ATTENTION TO HIS.IMMIGRATION POLICY PERHAPS AS.WELL..MORE INTERESTINGLY TO ME IS.WHERE DONALD TRUMP TAKES THIS.FROM HERE..IS HE GOING TO KEEP ESCALATING.THIS AGAINST TED CRUZ?.AND THAT WILL BECOME VERY, VERY.INTERESTING..>> I'M SORT OF SURPRISED, SARA,.AND YOU'VE BEEN ON THE ROAD.COVERING HIM FOR MONTHS AND.MONTHS NOW, WHY IT'S ONLY BEEN.COMING UP NOW..I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT IT WOULD.HAVE BEEN RAISED A WHILE AGO.GIVEN THE FACT TED CRUZ WAS IN.FACT BORN IN CANADA..IS IT ONLY BECAUSE TED CRUZ.POTENTIALLY REPRESENTS A SERIOUS.THREAT TO TRUMP IN IOWA RIGHT.NOW?.>> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY.WHY..I THINK EARLY ON DONALD TRUMP.WAS HAPPY TO PLAY NICE WITH TED.CRUZ, YOU KNOW..THERE WAS A WHILE WHERE A SPAT.WAS EMERGING AFTER TED CRUZ.UTHE.QUICKLY MADE UP..AND THE REALITY OF THAT IS.BECAUSE THEY'RE COMPETING FOR A.LOT OF THESE SAME VOTERS IN.IOWA..AND SO BOTH OF THEM WANT TO BE.VERY CAREFUL NOT TO ALIENATE.ANYONE..I THINK TRUMP IS NOW MAKING THE.CALCULATION THAT THE TIME FOR.THAT IS OVER, THAT HE NEEDS TO.BE HARSHER WITH TED CRUZ WHEN IT.COMES TO THIS ISSUE..EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO.IMMIGRATION YOU SAW HIM GOING.AFTER TED CRUZ SAYING HE WANTS.TO BUILD A WALL..YOU HEARD HIM SAY THAT TED CRUZ.IS PRO AMNESTY..SO I THINK WE ARE STARTING TO.SEE AN ESCALATION OF THESE.ATTACKS FROM DONALD TRUMP..>> AND, WOLF, LET ME JUST SAY.THAT WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT.CRUZ IS THAT HE'S NOT REALLY.TAKING BAIT HERE..CRUZ IS REACTING TO THIS WITH.SORT OF HUMOR..HE'S REACTING TO IT KIND OF IN.SORROW, NOT IN ANGER..BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET.INTO A FIGHT WITH DONALD TRUMP.TO GIVE DONALD TRUMP AN EXCUSE.TO ATTACK HIM EVEN MORE..BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT'S NOT.GOING TO REALLY BENEFIT HIM IN.ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM..SO HE'S KIND OF BACKING OFF ON.THIS..AND LETTING DONALD TRUMP PUNCH.AT HIM WITHOUT REALLY PUNCHING.BACK BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NO.BENEFIT IN IT FOR HIM..SO I KIND OF APPLAUD HIM FOR THE.WAY HE'S REACTED..>> JEFF, WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO.WHAT TRUMP HAD TO SAY ABOUT THE.VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION IN.NORTH KOREA RIGHT NOW?.HE'S NOT IN FAVOR OF ANY PR.PREEMPTIVE STRIKE BUT REALLY.WANTS CLIE NA TO GET THE JOB.DONE, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?.>> WOLF, HE'S CLEARLY NOT AN.INTERVENTIONIST, BUT ON THIS HE.MAY BE VOICING THE VIEW OF.POTENTIALLY A LOT OF AMERICANS.SAYING WHY IS THIS OUR PROBLEM.AGAIN, CAN YOU TELL ME EXACTLY.WHY WE SHOULD BE SORT OF TAKING.THE LEAD ON THIS HERE?.BUT I'M STILL NOT SURE AS A JOB.INTERVIEW AS SOMEONE RUNNING FOR.PRESIDENT HERE IT'S ALL THAT.REALISTIC..OF COURSE THIS IS OUR PROBLEM..OF COURSE THIS IS THE WORLD'S.PROBLEM..SO I THINK THAT HE'S A LITTLE.BIT NAIVE ON SOME RESPECT, BUT.THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT SOME OF.HIS LANGUAGE IS NOT GOING TO.WORK..BUT HE WAS ACTUALLY INCORRECT IN.ONE THING HE SAID..HE SAID THE U.S. IS PAYING FOR.ALL THIS..ACTUALLY, SOUTH KOREA PAYS THE.U.S. GOVERNMENT SOME $700.MILLION TO SORT OF HELP PROTECT.THEM HERE..SO HE WAS WRONG ON THAT FRONT..THERE IS AN AGREEMENT THAT IS.SIGNED EVERY FEW YEARS OR SO.BETWEEN BOTH GOVERNMENTS..SO THE U.S. IS NOT FOOTING THIS.BILL ALONE IN ITS ENTIRETY..SOUTH KOREA IS PAYING FOR A LOT.OF THAT, WOLF..>> IT SEEMS THOUGH, SARA, AND.YOU'VE COVERED HIM AS I SAY NOW.FOR MONTHS, THAT THERE'S ALMOST.A TRUMP DOCTORATE, LET CHINA.TAKE CARE OF NORTH KOREA..LET RUSSIA TAKE CARE OF SYRIA..LET GERMANY TAKE CARE OF.UKRAINE..YOU SEE THAT KIND OF STANDOFF.FOREIGN POLICY STRATEGY.EMERGING?.>> YEAH, I THINK THIS IS REALLY.INTERESTING BECAUSE TRUMP HAS.RALLIED SO MANY SUPPORTERS BY.PROJECTING THIS IMAGE OF.STRENGTH BY SAYING THAT AMERICA.IS GOING TO BE THE STRONGEST.COUNTRY..BUT WHEN YOU DIG INTO HIS VIEWS.ON THESE SPECIFIC ISSUES,.DEALING WITH THESE SPECIFIC.WORLD LEADERS AND HE'S WRITTEN.ABOUT THIS MANY TIMES BEFORE IN.HIS BOOKS, HE ACTUALLY IS NOT.VERY INTERVENTIONIST IN HIS.VIEWS..HE HAS WRITTEN BEFORE IT NEEDS.TO BE -- IF WE'RE GOING TO GET.INVOLVED IN A CONFLICT SOMEWHERE.ELSE, THERE NEEDS TO BE A VERY.CLEAR THREAT TO THE U.S., A.CLEAR THREAT THAT THE AMERICAN.PEOPLE UNDERSTAND..AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT.REFLECTED NOW WHEN YOU SEE HIM.TALK ABOUT THE SITUATION IN.NORTH KOREA..AND WHEN YOU SEE HIM TALK ABOUT.RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN.WHILE OTHER CANDIDATES WERE ON.THE STUMP THIS WEEK BASHING HIM,.COMPARING HIM TO A KGB MEMBER,.DONALD TRUMP WAS ESSENTIALLY.THANKING PUTIN FOR COMPLEMENTING.HIM..>> BUT HE ALSO SAYS ON THE OTHER.HAND LET'S BOMB THE HELL OUT OF.THE OIL FEEDS IN IRAQ..SO WHICH IS IT?.IS HE SAYING LET THE CHINESE.HANDLE THIS NORTH KOREA OR IS HE.GOING TO BE INTERVENTIONIST AND.BOMB THE HELL OUT OF THE OIL.FIELDS?.>> RIGHT, TRIES TO PLAY BOTH.WAYS..>> MORE TO BE COMING FROM THIS..>> EXACTLY..>> EVERYBODY STANDBY BECAUSE WE.HAVE MUCH MORE OF MY ONE-ON-ONE.INTERVIEW WITH DONALD TRUMP.COMING UP..AMONG OTHER THINGS HE TALKS.ABOUT HIS WIFE'S ROLE IN THE.CAMPAIGN AND POSSIBLE ROLE AS.FIRST LADY..>> SHE MADE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT.OF MONEY..SHE WAS A VERY, VERY SUCCESSFUL.PERSON AS A MODEL..AND I THINK SHE'S GOING TO BE A.FANTASTIC FIRST LADY..>>> MORE ON THE BREAKING.POLITICAL NEWS..DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T KNOW IF.BARACK OBAMA IS A CITIZEN AND.URGING THE SENATOR TO ASK A.FEDERAL JUDGE RIGHT AWAY

CUPP, KEVIN MADDEN AND ANNA.NAVARRO..YOU HEARD TRUMP AVOID TO SAY.WHETHER HE THINKS CRUZ IS A.NATURAL BORN CITIZEN..I ASSUME TRUMP THINKS THIS COULD.BE A WINNING STRATEGY FOR HIM..WHAT DO YOU THINK?.>> OBVIOUSLY, THE BROMANCE IS.OVER..DONALD TRUMP SAID THIS IS NOT AN.ISSUE..THAT WAS BEFORE TED CRUZ STARTED.SURGING IN IOWA AND HE FELT A.THREAT FROM TED CRUZ..A FEW WEEKS AGO WE SAW DONALD.TRUMP GO AFTER TED CRUZ AND SAID.HE'S A MANIAC AND GOT BACKLASH.AND SO I THINK HE'S GOT TO TREAD.CAREFULLY..WE'VE SEEN HIM IN THE LAST.COUPLE WEEKS TRY TO POKE HOLES.ON WHETHER A CUBAN CAN BE AN.EVANG.EVANGELICAL, WHICH IS.RIDICULOUS, OF COURSE THEY CAN..>> KEVIN, YOUR TAKE?.>> LOOK, HERE IS WHAT TRUMP IS.DOING..A CLASSIC TRUMP MOVE IS HE'S.TRYING TO CREATE A DISTRACTION.THAT GETS, THAT GETS TED CRUZ.OFF MESSAGE AND PUTS HIM ON THE.DEFENSIVE..TED CRUZ JUST PUT OUT AN AD, A.VERY STRONG AD, A VERY EFFECTIVE.AD FOR THOSE FOLKS OUT IN IOWA.WHO CARE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF.IMMIGRATION AND WHAT WE SPENT.THE LAST 48 HOURS NOT TALKING.ABOUT IMMIGRATION OR TED CRUZ'.MESSAGE ON IT BUT INSTEAD,.WHETHER OR NOT HE WAS BORN IN.CANADA OR WHETHER OR NOT HE'S.ELIGIBLE FOR THE PRESIDENCY..THAT HAS TAKEN TED CRUZ OFF.MESSAGE..SO THAT IS WHERE IT'S BEEN.EFFECTIVE..THE OTHER THING IS GOT THE MEDIA.CHASING THE RABBIT..IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO A DOG.RACE, THEY GOT THE MECHANICAL.RABBIT AND DOGS GO ROUND AND.ROUND CHASING IT BUT A RABBIT.THEY NEVER CATCH..THE MEDIA IS COVERING THIS IN A.WAY THAT'S CREATING, PUTTING.WHERE TED CRUZ HAS TO ANSWER A.LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT.FOCUSED..IN THAT WAY AGAIN, THIS IS.ADVANTAGE TRUMP..>> S.E..WHAT KIND OF OPTIONS DOES.SENATOR CRUZ HAVE IN BATTLING.TRUMP ON THIS ISSUE?.>> YEAH, I MEAN, I DISAGREE.SLIGHTLY WITH KEVIN, I THINK, I.THINK THIS COULD BE ADVANTAGE.TRUMP BUT IF CRUZ STAYS ON.MESSAGE AND DOESN'T CHASE THE.RABBIT WITH THE MEDIA, I THINK.HE WINS..THIS IS A LOSING STRATEGY BOTH.HISTORICALLY AND CURRENTLY AS.ANNA MENTIONED, TRUMP TRIED TO.QUESTION TED CRUZ' E VAVANGELIC.AND IOWA VOTERS DIDN'T TAKE.KINDLY TO THAT AND IN THE PAST.THE FOLKS, REMEMBER IN 2008,.WHEN DONALD TRUMP AND OTHER.REPUBLICANS TRIED TO CHALLENGE.OBAMA'S CITIZENSHIP..WHEN THEY TRIED TO CHALLENGE A.DEMOCRAT'S CITIZEN SHIP, THAT.DIDN'T MOBILIZE ENOUGH.REPUBLICANS TO COME OUT AND VOTE.OBAMA OUT..I DON'T THINK A REPUBLICAN.CHALLENGING ANOTHER REPUBLICAN.CITIZENSHIP IS GOING TO MOBILIZE.SOMEHOW EVEN MORE REPUBLICANS TO.COME OUT..I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S A.WINNING STRATEGY..CRUISE NEEDS TO SIT TIGHT AND.LET THIS PASS..>> LET'S TALK ABOUT NORTH KOREA.AND ANNA, I'LL START WITH YOU..YOU HEARD WHAT DONALD TRUMP HAD.TO SAY BASICALLY AN AWFUL.SITUATION BUT CHINA HAS ENORMOUS.INFLUENCE OVER NORTH KOREA..LET THEM GET THE JOB DONE..>> HE'S BEING ACTUALLY VERY.CONSISTENT..THIS IS THE TRUMP DOCTRINE WHEN.WE HAVE FOREIGN POLICY TURMOIL.FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES, HE IS.STRIKING AT A NERVE WITH THE.AMERICAN PEOPLE..HE'S VERY GOOD AT THAT, BEING.ABLE TO TELL THE POLLS OF THE.AMERICAN PEOPLE OF THE BASE OF.THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND SAY WHY.DO WE HAVE TO BE THE POLICEMEN.OF THE WORLD AND PUTTING THE.BURDEN ON CHINA..WHEN IT COMES TO SYRIA, HE PUTS.THE BURDEN ON RUSSIA..BUT I THINK HE'S ON SHORT.DETAILS TO THE UNITED STATES AND.WHAT HE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF.WOULD DO AND THAT'S SOMETHING.WHERE HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO FILL.IN THE BLANKS..>> KEVIN, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF.THIS SO-CALLED TRUMP DOCTRINE?.>> I DON'T MAKE -- I THINK.DOCTRINES ARE MUCH MORE.SUBST.SUBSTANTIVE..DOCTRINES HAVE MUCH MORE.DETAILS..I THINK DONALD TRUMP WAS SHORT.ON BOTH..LOOK, HE OFFERS CONFLICTING.MESSAGES ON SO MANY ISSUES AND.PARTICULARLY ON FOREIGN POLICY.AND SAYS WE NEED TO BE TOUGHER.ON CHINA AT THE SAME TIME.AMERICA NEEDS TO RECEIVE FROM.THE WORLD A CHINA TO BE STRONGER.IN A REGION OF THE WORLD THAT'S.IMPORTANT STRATEGICALLY FOR THE.UNITED STATES..THE QUESTION FOR DONALD TRUMP,.WHICH IS IT?.YOU CAN'T BE BOTH..THE BIG FRUSTRATION HERE FOR SO.MANY OF DONALD TRUMP'S OPPONENTS.IS THAT HE NEVER SEEMS TO PAY A.PRICE FOR THE LACK OF SUBSTANCE,.LACK OF DETAILS AND HYPOCRISY..AND THAT I THINK IS REALLY.SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO.HAVE TO SEE IF THE CAMPAIGNS.BELIEVE THAT IF THEY GO AT IT.MORE, IF THEY OFFER MORE VOLUME.AND OFFER MORE OF A STRONGER,.MORE OF A STRONGER CRITIQUE, IT.WILL PERSUADE VOTERS TO.UNDERSTAND A POLICY IN EVEN A.SLIGHT WAY..>> KEVIN MADDEN, ANNA, S.E..CUPP, GUYS, THANKS VERY MUCH..MUCH MORE COMING UP ON THIS,.ALSO COMING UP, NORTH KOREA.SENDS OUT SHOCK WAVES WITH A.CLAIM IT TESTED A HYDROGEN BOMB..>>> WE'LL ALSO HAVE MUCH MORE OF.MY ONE ON ONE INTERVIEW WITH.DONALD TRUMP AS THE REPUBLICAN.PRESIDENTIAL FRONT RUNNER WEIGHS.IN ON THE VERY, VERY SENSITIVE.ISSUE OF GUNS IN AMERICA..>> SO MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE IN THE.GUN CONTROL WHEN WE HAVE THESE.DEBATES, THEY ALWAYS LOSE THE.DEBATE TO ME AND I CALL THEM UP.THE NEXT DAY..HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT?.I STILL HAVEN'T CHANGED MY MIND..I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS..

ARSENAL..VERY ALARMALARMING..>> YOU MADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO.NORTH KOREA..WHY WOULD THAT CLAIM A HYDROGEN.BOMB AS PART OF THE TEST?.>> BECAUSE THEY WANT THE.INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO SIT.DOWN AND TALK..THEY WANT A LIFTING OF SANCTIONS.AND NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.WITH THE UNITED STATES..THAT'S ONE ASPECT OF IT..FOR THE DOMESTIC AUDIENCE AND.WORKER'S PARTY, HIGH LEVEL.LEADERSHIP, KIM JONG UN WANTS TO.PROTECT POWER SO BY CLAIMING TO.SUCCESSFULLY CARRY OFF AN H BOMB.TEST, A WEAPON POTENTIALLY.HUNDREDS OF TIMES MORE POWERFUL.THAN PREVIOUS TESTS, JUST TWO.DAYS BEFORE HIS BIRTHDAY, IT'S.CERTAINLY SHOWING THAT KIM JONG.UN IS TRYING TO SAY LOOK, I'M.THE BOSS IN CONTROL AND EVEN.THOUGH OUR MILITARY EQUIPMENT ON.ONE LEVEL IS MORE OUTDATED,.WE'RE BUILDING MISSILES AND.DEVELOPING WAR HEADS AND NOT.AFRAID TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT WE.HAVE THIS CAPABILITY..WOLF?.>> WILL RIPLEY IN BEIJING FOR.US..THANK YOU VERY MUCH..LET'S GET MORE ON THE BREAKING.NEWS..JOINING US NOW, JAMES RISCH OF.IDAHO..SENATOR, WHAT ARE YOU LEARNING.ABOUT NORTH KOREA'S CLAIM THEY.ACTUALLY TESTED A HYDROGEN BOMB?.>> WOLF, THAT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY..THIS IS THEIR FOURTH TEST, AS.YOU KNOW, AND THE YIELD FROM ALL.THE SEISMIC MATERIAL THAT HAS.BEEN REVIEWED INDICATE IT'S.ABOUT THE SAME AS WHAT THE.PREVIOUS TESTS WERE..THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY IT.COULD BE A HYDROGEN BOMB UNDER.THOSE, UNDER THAT SCENARIO..IT'S JUST HIGHLY UNLIKELY AT.THIS POINT THAT THEY DID DO THAT.TEST..>> DID THE U.S. HAVE ANY ADVANCE.INTELLIGENCE WARNING THAT THIS.TEST WAS ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE?.>> YOU KNOW, WOLF, WITHOUT GOING.INTO DETAILS, I CAN TELL YOU.THIS WAS NO SURPRISE TO THE.INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY..IN A GENERAL SENSE, WE KNOW THAT.EVERY YEAR, TWO YEARS, THREE,.SOMETIMES FOUR YEARS, THE NORTH.KOREANS DO SOMETHING..THEY PUSH THE ENVELOPE AND MAKE.A STATEMENT..THEY WERE WAY OVER DUE..SO THIS DID NOT COME AS A.SURPRISE, REALLY, TO THOSE IN.THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY OR.FOR THAT MATTER, TO MILITARY.PEOPLE OR ANYONE ELSE WHO.FOLLOWS THESE..>> WHAT CAN THE U.S. DO ABOUT.THIS POTENTIAL THREAT OF NUCLEAR.NORTH KOREA, MORE ECONOMIC.SANCTIONS, CLEARLY ON THE TABLE..THEY HAVEN'T DONE MUCH AT LEAST.SO FAR..>> WOLF, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE.ALREADY SO HEAVILY SANCTIONED,.IT'S REALLY HARD TO TURN THE.SCREW MUCH TIGHTER BUT THERE ARE.SOME THINGS..I THINK WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.IS THEY ARE GOING TO BE BANKING.SANCTIONS THAT THEY CAN TURN THE.SCREW A LITTLE TIGHTER ON WITH.SOME OF THE BANKS THAT THEY ARE.DOING BUSINESS WITH IN ASIA..I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THAT'S.GOING TO BE LOOKED AT..YOU KNOW THE MOST TROUBLING.THING ABOUT ALL THIS IS THE AD.MISSION BY THE CHINESE THEY.DIDN'T HAVE ADVANCED NOTICE OF.THIS..I MEAN, KIM JUDNG'S FATHER WAS.MUCH CLOSER..NOBODY KNOWS HOW HIS MIND WORKS.BUT DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM.ABOUT THE ONLY FRIEND THEY HAVE.ON THE PLANET AND ISN'T A WARM.RELATIONSHIP AT THAT IS NOT A.VERY SMART MOVE FOR ANYBODY AND.THAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT'S.HAPPENING..WHAT THAT TELLS YOU IS, THE.ROGUENESS, THE DISCONNECT, HOW.THEY ARE JUST A PART FROM THE.REST OF THE WORLD AND AS WAS.SAID IN ONE OF THE EARLIER.SEGMENTS, IF ANYBODY CAN CONTROL.THEM, IT'S THE CHINESE WHERE.THEY PROVIDE AS MUCH FOOD AND.AID AS THEY DO AND IF THIS IS.SEPARATING, IT'S TROUBLING..IT REALLY IS..>> THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT TWEETED.THIS MORNING AND I'LL READ TO.YOU, SENATOR, WHICH COUNTRY IS.EXACERBATING DIVIDE BOMBING.YEMEN AND UNDERMINING.GOVERNMENTS IN IRAQ AND SYRIA BY.PROVIDING FUNDS AND ARMS TO.ISIS..HE'S OF USUALLY ACCUSING AUDIO.ARABIA HIS RIVAL OF THAT BUT HOW.COULD WHAT IS HAPPENING IN NORTH.KOREA AFFECT THE MIDDLE EAST.SPECIFICALLY THAT U.S. BROKERED.INTERNATIONAL NUCLEAR DEAL WITH.IRAN?.>> WELL, I THINK IT MAY BE THE.REVERSE OF THAT, ACTUALLY..I THINK THE NORTH KOREANS ARE.EMBOLDENED BY HOW IRAN HAS ACTED.OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS OR SO.WHERE THEY NEGOTIATED THIS.AGREEMENT..THE I THINK WASN'T EVEN DRY ON.THE AGREEMENT AND THEY WERE.VIOLATING THE RESOLUTIONS THAT.THE U.N. PUT OUT ABOUT TESTING.ICPMs AND THAT SORT OF THING SO.THEY ARE -- YOU KNOW, THEY LOOK.AND SEE THAT IRAN, NOT ONLY IS.NOT HAVING ANY DIFFICULTIES AS A.RESULT OF IT, IT'S ACTUALLY.HAVING SANCTIONS LIFTED..I THINK THE MESSAGE THEY ARE.GETTING IS THAT THE WORLD IS.WEAK AND THE STRONGER THEY SHOW.THEMSELVES, THE BETTER THEY ARE.GOING TO BE TREATED AND OF.COURSE, NOTHING IS FURTHER FROM.THE TRUTH IN THE MINDS OF MOST.OF US..>> SENATOR RISCH STAND BY..I WANT TO GET TO MORE OF MY.INTERVIEW WITH DONALD TRUMP..WE COVERED A LOT OF HOT BUTTON.ISSUES ON RACE FOR THE WHITE.HOUSE TODAY INCLUDING THE ISSUE.OF GUN CONTROL..>> WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE SECOND.AMENDMENT..HAVE NO CHOICE..WE HAVE TO DO THAT..IT'S VERY IMPORTANT..>> THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE.BELIEVES IN THE SECOND.AMENDMENT, TOO..>> I DON'T THINK HE DOES AND.HILLARY IS A DISASTER..HILLARY IS GOING TO BE WORSE.THAN OBAMA..

HE'S A NATURAL.BORN CITIZEN..YOU KNOW THE CONSTITUTION SAYS.NO PERSON EXCEPT A NATURAL BORN.CITIZEN SHALL BE ELIGIBLE TO THE.OFFICE OF PRESIDENT..DO YOU BELIEVE SENATOR TED CRUZ.IS A NATURAL BORN CITIZEN?.>> I DON'T KNOW, TO BE HONEST.AND I LIKE HIM A LOT AND I DON'T.LIKE THE ISSUE..I DON'T LIKE EVEN BRINGING IT UP.AND YOU KNOW, WASN'T ME THAT.BROUGHT IT UP..""THE WASHINGTON POST"" DOING AN.INTERVIEW AND ONE OF THE.QUESTIONS THEY ASKED ME WAS THIS.QUESTION AND, YOU KNOW, THEY.WENT WITH IT AND I WASN'T VERY.AGGRESSIVE WITH THE ANSWER.EXCEPT ONE THING, YOU CAN'T HAVE.SOMEBODY RUNNING IF THE.DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO AT SOME.POINT AND ONE OF THEM THREATENED.TO BRING A SUIT BUT HOW CAN YOU.HAVE A NOMINEE RUNNING AGAINST A.DEMOCRAT, WHOEVER IT MAY BE,.PROBABLY HILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE.SHE'LL PROBABLY ESCAPE THE.E-MAIL PROBLEM, WHICH IS.DISGUSTING THAT SHE'S ABLE TO.BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE -- ARE.DOING FAR LESS AND THAT'S A VERY.MAJOR CONSEQUENCE THAT'S BEEN.TERRIBLE BUT PROBABLY HILLARY..HOW DO YOU RUN AGAINST THE.DEMOCRAT, WHOEVER IT MAY BE AND.YOU HAVE THIS HANGING OVER YOUR.HEAD IF THEY BRING A LAWSUIT..A LAWSUIT WOULD TAKE TWO OR.THREE --.>> HE SAYS HE'S A NATURAL BORN.CITIZEN BECAUSE HIS MOTHER WAS.U.S. BORN, A U.S. CITIZEN AND AS.A RESULT, HE'S A NATURAL BORN.CITIZEN..>> I HOPE HE'S RIGHT..I WANT TO WIN THIS FAIR AND.SQUARE AND I DON'T WANT TO WIN.ON

QUICKLY..IT CAN GO QUICKLY..DECLARETORY JUDGMENT..I'VE USED IT NUMEROUS TIMES..I'VE BEEN GOOD AT IT..WHAT TED DOESN'T WANT TO HAPPEN.IS HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE IN.THERE..I MEAN, I THINK I'M GOING TO.WIN..I'M LEADING IN EVERY POLL BY A.LOT..BUT I HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS IN.THE REPUBLICAN PARTY..I HAVE FRIENDS ALL OVER THE.PLACE, ALL RIGHT?.IF TED SHOULD EKE IT OUT AND I.HOPE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND.HE'S GOT THIS CLOUD OVER HIS.HEAD, I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING.TO BE POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DO.VERY WELL..I DON'T THINK IT'S ACTUALLY.POSSIBLE FOR THE REPUBLICANS TO.LET IT HAPPEN BECAUSE HE'LL HAVE.THIS LEFT..WHAT YOU DO IS GO IN IMMEDIATELY.LIKE TOMORROW, THIS AFTERNOON.AND GO TO FEDERAL COURT, ASK FOR.DECLARE TORY JUDGMENT..YOU WANT THE COURT TO RULE..AND ONCE THE COURT RULES, YOU.HAVE YOUR DECISION..>> BUT THAT COULD TAKE A LONG.TIME..BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE.SUPREME COURT HAS EVER REALLY.RULED ON WHAT IS A NATURAL BORN.CITIZEN..>> THAT'S THE PROBLEM..THERE IS THIS DOUBT..PEOPLE HAVE DOUBT..AGAIN, THIS WAS NOT MY.SUGGESTION..I DIDN'T BRING THIS UP..A REPORTER ASKED ME THE.QUESTION..BUT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BROUGHT.IT UP AND YOU HAD SOMEBODY, A.CONGRESSMAN SAY NO MATTER WHAT.HAPPENS, WE'RE GOING TO BE SUING.ON THIS MATTER..THAT'S A TOUGH MATTER FOR TED..AGAIN, I DIDN'T BRING IT UP,.WOLF..THIS IS BROUGHT UP AND ASKED OF.ME AS A QUESTION..>> I'VE HEARD EVERYTHING YOU.SAID ON FOREIGN POLICY OVER THE.PAST SEVERAL MONTHS..THERE SEEMS TO BE AND CORRECT ME.IF I'M WRONG AN EMERGING TRUMP.DOCTRINE..YOU WANT CHINA TO TAKE CARE OF.NORTH KOREA AND RUSSIA TO TAKE.CARE OF SYRIA AND GERMANY TO.TAKE CARE OF UKRAINE..BASICALLY, YOU WANT TO OUTSOURCE.THESE SENSITIVE ISSUES..>> I WANT HELP..THE UNITED STATES ARE LIKE THE.POLICEMEN OF THE WORLD..WE'RE INVOLVED WITH UKRAINE BUT.GERMANY DOESN'T CARE..GERMANY SHOULD CARE MORE THAN.US..WHY ARE WE ALWAYS OUT THERE?.PUTIN SAID NICE THINGS ABOUT ME..HE UNDERSTANDS I GET IT..I GET IT..MOST PEOPLE DON'T..YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING ON IN.THE WORLD..WE'RE THE POLICEMEN OF THE.WORLD..WE OWE $19 TRILLION..WE JUST MADE A RIDICULOUS.BUDGET, THAT JUST GOT ABOVPPROV.IN ABOUT 15 SECONDS..WHO WOULD BELIEVE A BUDGET LIKE.THAT APPROVED SO QUICKLY..THE ONLY THING OBAMA NEGOTIATES.WELL WITH ARE REPUBLICANS..HE ONLY COMES UP ON TOP WITH.REPUBLICANS..IRAN BEATS HIM..EVERYBODY BEATS HIM..WE'RE THE LAUGHING STOCK ALL.OVER THE WORLD..THE REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE.ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES FOR.ALLOWING THAT BUDGET TO PASS..WE'RE AT $19 TRILLION PLUS WE'RE.GOING TO BE AT $21 TRILLION.RIGHT NOW, SO, YEAH, I WANT.OTHER COUNTRIES TO GET INVOLVED..>> LET'S TALK ABOUT OTHER.TENSIONS..AS BAD AS THE MIDDLE EAST IS,.IT'S GETTING WORSE, TEXTS.BETWEEN SAUDI ARABIA AND IRAN..THE EXECUTION, THE RANSACKING.AND BURNING OF THE EMBASSY IN TO.MAN..WOULD YOU CONDEMN SAUDI ARABIA.FOR THE BEHEADINGS OF COLLAR I.CANS AND TERRORISTS..>> THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A.GREAT ALLY..THEY EXECUTED ALL OF THESE.PEOPLE, WHO KNOWS..HERE IF WE EXECUTE LIKE ONE.PERSON A YEAR IT'S LIKE A MAJOR.EVENT..THEY DO IT LIKE ROUTINELY..NE.NEVER.NEVERTHELESS, I HAVE VERY GOOD.FRIENDS FROM SAUDI ARABIA..THEY HAVE TO PAY..IF WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT THEM.FROM

ISRAEL --.>> THEY ALL HATED IT..ARE YOU CONCERNED THE SAUDIS.GIVEN THIS TENSION WITH IRAN,.SAUDI ARABIA MAY DECIDE WE'LL BY.A NUCLEAR BOMB..THE PROLIFERATION ISSUE IS.REALLY SERIOUS..>> I SAID THAT THAT DEAL AND I.SAID IT TO CNN, I SAID TO.ANYBODY THAT WOULD LISTEN IS.GOING TO LEAD TO GREAT NUCLEAR.PROLIFERATION AND THAT'S WHAT IS.HAPPENING..THAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.AND YOU CAN'T BLAME THEM..>> THE AMBASSADOR, HE TOLD ME.LAST YEAR HE WASN'T RULING OUT.THE POSSIBILITY THAT SAUDI.ARABIA COULD GO AHEAD AND.DEVELOP OR MAYBE EVEN BUY A.NUCLEAR BOMB..THEY HAVE A LOT OF MONEY..>> THEY HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY,.BELIEVE ME, THEY HAVE PLENTY OF.MONEY..WHEN I SEE YEMEN AND THE EVENT.WITH THE IN IRAN, WHICH WAS.CAUSED IN MY OPINION BY THE.GOVERNMENT OF IRAN AS AN EXCUSE.BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE OVER.SAUDI ARABIA AND GET THE OIL AND.TAKE OVER SAUDI ARABIA AND THE.ONLY REASON THEY WANTED YEMEN IS.THEY HAVE A NICE LONG BORDER IN..PERFECT FEED..YOU KNOW, AT SOME POINT WE HAVE.TO BE REIMBURSED..WE PAY RENT IN SAUDI ARABIA.WHERE WE PAY RENT..WE'RE PROTECTING THEM..WHY ARE WE PAYING RENT?.THEY HAVE TO PAY UP..SOUTH KOREA, GERMANY..WE PROTECT GERMANY, YOU KNOW.THAT, RIGHT?.WE

THE FIRST THING I DO IS.PROTECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT..THE SECOND THING I DO IS I.WOULDN'T USE EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO.DO THIS..YOU GOT TO GET PEOPLE..OUR COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON THE.BASIS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO.NEGOTIATE BACK AND FORTH WITH.DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF DIFFERENT.PARTIES AND YOU COME TO A.CONCLUSION THROUGH NEGOTIATION.AND COMPROMISE..YOU DON'T GO AND JUST KEEP.SIGNING ORDERS AND ALL HE'S.DOING IS TAKING CHUNKS OUT OF.THE SECOND AMENDMENT..THAT WON'T HAPPEN..YOU KNOW --.>> BUT YOU DON'T WANT CONVICTED.FELONS OR MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE TO.BE ABLE TO GO TO A GUN --.ANYPLACE, ONLINE OR --.>> WHEN YOU

PEOPLE.THAT GAVE THEM A WEDDING PARTY,.THESE PEOPLE THAT GOT KILLED.GAVE THEM A WEDDING PARTY..THEY WENT IN AND SHOT..IF A COUPLE PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM.HAD GUNS OR IF A COUPLE PEOPLE.IN PARIS HAD GUNS, YOU WOULDN'T.HAVE HAD 130 PEOPLE OR 14 PEOPLE.IN CALIFORNIA LAYING DEAD WITH.MORE TO FOLLOW BECAUSE YOU HAVE.SO MANY PEOPLE SO BADLY WOUNDED..IF PEOPLE IN PARIS AS AN.EXAMPLE, WHICH IS THE TOUGHEST.GUN CONTROL PLACE ON EARTH, THEY.SAY, PARIS AND FRANCE, NOW IF.YOU'RE A BAD GUY YOU CAN'T HAVE.A GUN..IF YOU'RE A GOOD GUY, THEY CAN..IF THEY HAD GUNS RIGHT HERE ON.THEIR ANKLE AND THOSE GUYS.WALKED IN AND STARTED SHOOTING.IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A DIFFERENT.STORY..SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S VERY.INTERESTING..SO MANY PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE IN.THE GUN CONTROL WHEN WE HAVE.THESE DEBATES, THEY ALWAYS

THAT.HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO TAKE.EVERYONE'S GUNS BASICALLY AWAY..GLORIA, ON THE HEELS OF THE.PRESIDENT'S ANNOUNCEMENT.YESTERDAY ON GUN CONTROL, TRUMP.INSISTED HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO.PROTECT THE SECOND AMENDMENT..THAT IS GOING TO PLAY WELL AMONG.CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS..>> SURE..ABSOLUTELY..IT WILL PLAY WELL AMONG.CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS..HE UNDERSTANDS THAT AND LOOK, I.THINK WHAT THE ARGUMENT HE IS.MAKING IS THE ARGUMENT, THE.SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT THAT.WE'VE HEARD TIME AND TIME AGAIN.WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY IF YOU DO.ANYTHING TO EXPAND A BACKGROUND.CHECKS IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR.FORM, THAT WOULD LEAD TO SOME.KIND OF GUN REGISTRY AND THAT IN.TURN WOULD LEAD TO SOME KIND OF.CONFISCATION OF YOUR GUNS AND HE.MADE THE CLEAR POINT ABOUT.HILLARY CLINTON THAT SHE WOULD.BE QUOTE WORSE THAN PRESIDENT.OBAMA AS HE PUTS IT AND IT'S.CLEAR HE'S TAKING DIRECT AIM AT.HER AND SAYING THAT SHE WOULD.TAKE AWAY YOUR GUNS BECAUSE THIS.PLAYS VERY, VERY WELL WITH.REPUBLICAN PRIMARY VOTERS..ON THE OTHER HAND, THIS ALSO.KNOW PLAYS VERY WELL FOR.DEMOCRATS TO BE PROGUN CONTROL..THEY HAVE BEEN AFRAID OF THE.ISSUE SINCE 2000..A LOT OF THEM BELIEVE IT COST AL.GORE THE ELECTION BUT.DEMOGRAPHICS IN THE COUNTRY.CHANGED..THEY ARE LOOKING AT YOUNGER,.MORE URBAN VOTERS WHERE GUN.CONTROL IS A POPULAR ISSUE FOR.THEM..>> RON, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE AWAY.FROM WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID.ABOUT SAUDI ARABIA, THE CONFLICT.IT'S HAVING WITH IRAN, WHAT HE.HAD TO SAY ABOUT NORTH KOREA..DID HE SOUND PRESIDENTIAL OR ON.TOP OF THE SENSITIVE ISSUES?.>> VERY INTERESTING..BROAD POINT AND NARROW POINT.ABOUT SAUDI ARABIA..THE BROAD POINT, WHAT HE SAID.ENCAPSULATES WHAT I SEE AS THE.CONSISTENT LINE IN HIS FOREIGN.POLICY AND MORE BROADLY HIS.INTERACTION WITH THE WORLD,.WHICH IS WHAT YOU CALL A.DEFENSIVE NATIONAL..VERY NARROW DEFINITION OF.AMERICAN SELF-INTEREST IN WORLD.EVENTS..ON THE ONE END, HE SAYS IF.SOMEONE THREATENS US, WE'LL GO.BOMB OIL FIELDS IF ISIS IS A.THREAT BUT REJECTS THE BROADER.ROLES FOR THE U.S. OF BALANCING.REGIONAL, BALANCE OF POWER,.PROVIDING KIND OF BROAD SECURITY.WITHOUT DEMANDING MORE..SO IT'S A VERY BELLIGERENT BUT.NARROW VISION OF AMERICA'S OIL.ON THE WORLD..THE SECOND POINT IS SAUDI.ARABIA, THERE IS NO DOUBT IRAN.AND SAUDI ARABIA ARE BITTER.RIVALS FOR DOMINANCE AND ALSO.BITTER RIVALS IN TERMS OF BEING.THE LEADER OF THE SHIITE AND.SUNNI BLOCKS, I HAVE NOT HEARD.SOMEONE SAY IRAN PHYSICALLY.WANTS TO INVITE AND OCCUPY SAUDI.ARABIA AND TAKE THEIR OIL..>> HE WAS SUGGESTING THAT THAT.EVENTUALLY MOVING UP THROUGH THE.LONG BORDER BETWEEN YEMEN AND.SAUDI ARABIA AND CLEARLY MADE.THAT POINT..RYAN,  LIZZA, YOUR THOUGHTS?.>> SEE SEEMS TO WANT TO.OUTSOURCE FOREIGN POLICY TO ALL.OF THESE OTHER COUNTRIES, RIGHT.AND CONSTANTLY ASKING WHAT THE.IS THE U.S. GETTING OUT OF THE.DEALS AND WHY CAN'T CHINA SOLVE.OUR PROBLEM WITH NORTH KOREA,.RIGHT?.WHY CAN'T GERMANY SOLVE THE.PROBLEM WITH RUSSIA AND THE.UKRAINE AND IT SORT OF.CONTRADICTS THE SORT OF MUSCULAR.NATIONALISM THAT RON WAS.DESCRIBING, THE OTHER PART OF.HIS FOREIGN POLICY, WHICH IS HE.THINKS THAT THE PRESIDENT THAT.WE STILL LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE.THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED.STATES SNAPS HIS OR HER FINGER.AND THE REST OF THE WORLD JUST.BENDS TO OUR WISHES..I THINK A LOT OF FRANKLY THE WAY.HE DESCRIBES AMERICAN FOREIGN.POLICY IS SIMPLISTIC..HE CAN'T TELL CHINA TO SOLVE THE.PROBLEM IN NORTH KOREA AND HE.CAN'T JUST BOMB ISIS AND MAKE.THIS PROBLEM GO AWAY AND THAT.MOST OF THE FOREIGN POLICY.PROBLEMS OF THE OBAMA ERA ARE.INTRACTABLE BECAUSE THERE ARE NO.EASY SOLUTIONS AND THERE IS A.SUPER OFFICIAL APPEAL TO THE.KIND OF NATIONALISM THAT HE IS.PUTTING FORTH BUT IT'S THE --.THE WORLD IS MORE COMPLICATED.THAN DONALD TRUMP WOULD LIKE TO.BELIEVE..>> YOU ALSO HEARD, MICHAEL,.DONALD TRUMP SAY HE'S NOT.BACKING AWAY AT ALL FROM.BUILDING THAT WALL ALONG THE.U.S., MEXICO BORDER AND HE'S.INSISTING, YOU KNOW WHAT?.MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT..>> RIGHT..AND THEN WHEN YOU ASKED HIM FOR.SPECIFICITY, HE IMMEDIATELY.DODGED AND MOVED ON TO ANOTHER.ISSUE..I AGREE WITH RYAN SIMPLICITY.SELLS FOR DONALD TRUMP AND I.WILL GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THIS.WOLF..HE HAS A GREAT EAR..HIS INSTINCTS ARE RIGHT IN TUNE.WITH THE VERY POPULAR APPEAL.WITH THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS.BUT MAJORITY OF THE REPUBLICAN.BASE THUS FAR..WHAT YOU'RE GETTING FROM HIM IS.WHAT THEY MOST WANT TO HEAR AND.THEY ARE NOT DEMANDING ANY MORE.SPECIFICITY..>> GLORIA, IS THIS GOING TO HELP.HIM?.THIS FOREIGN POLICY TALK, WHAT.HE WANTS TO DO ABOUT NORTH KOREA.AND SYRIA AND SAUDI ARABIA,.UKRAINE AND IN IOWA..>> THE VOTER HAVES A BROADER.PACKAGE WHICH IS HIS SLOGAN.WHICH IS DONALD TRUMP IS THE MAN.THAT'S GOING TO MAKE AMERICA.GREAT AGAIN..SO IF YOU LIKE DONALD TRUMP,.YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE HIS FOREIGN.POLICY AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO.PARSE IT AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO.PICK IT APART..YOU'RE GOING TO SAY I LIKE WHAT.HE STANDS FOR..YOU LIKE THE FACT THAT HE'S.POLITICALLY CORRECT AND CALLS.OUT THE CHINESE AND THAT HE SAYS.THAT PUTIN LIKES HIM..YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO BE.OFFENDED BY THAT..BECAUSE HE'S A BIGGER PACKAGE.THAN THAT, WOLF..I THINK IN TERMS OF IOWA VOTERS.OR NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS THAT.KIND OF LIKE WHAT HE REPRESENTS,.HE HASN'T SPENT HIS TIME ON THE.CAMPAIGN TRAIL BEING SPECIFIC IN.CASE YOU HADN'T NOTICED AND I.DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT HIS.CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT, AT LEAST NOT.YET..>> GO AHEAD, WOLF?.>> I THINK THERE IS A CONSISTENT.LINE HERE..AND OVER MANY DECADES..IT'S NARROW DEFINITION OF.AMERICAN INTEREST IN THE WORLD..WHEN HE BASICALLY COMES BACK.ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, AND NOT GOING.TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND PULLED.BACK IN ESSENCE BEHIND WALLS.UNLESS SOMEONE THREATENS US.DIRECTLY IN WHICH CASE WE'LL ACT.WITH OVERWHELMING FORCE..THAT'S THE CONSISTENT LINE WHEN.YOU HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT THESE.DIFFERENT CHALLENGES..IT'S LESS AND LESS THREATENS IN.WHICH CASE WE'LL DO MORE AND THE.VISION IS THE WORLD IS A.DANGEROUS PLACE..THEY ARE TRYING TO TAKE.ADVANTAGE OF THE U.S..WE HAVE TO KEEP OUT FOREIGN.INFLUENCES AND WHEN WE ARE.ENGAGING WITH THESE FOREIGN.COUNTRIES, OFTEN THEY TAKE.ADVANTAGE OF US..WE NEED A NARROW AND RUTHLESS.VISION OF AMERICAN.SELF-INTEREST..>> HE TOLD ME WHAT HE'S BEEN.SAYING FOR MANY, MANY YEARS THE.U.S. INTERVENTION IN IRAQ WAS A.HUGE, HUGE BLUNDER FOR THE.UNITED STATES..ALL RIGHT..EVERYONE STAND BY..WE JUST HEARD DONALD TRUMP.QUESTIONING WHETHER TED CRUZ CAN.BE PRESIDENT OF THE

CANADA..CRUZ TALKED ABOUT IT WITH OUR.CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT.DANA BASH..HE'S CALLING THIS A NONISSUE,.DANA..TELL US WHAT HE TOLD YOU..>> Reporter: YOU ALL KNOW THAT.TED CRUZ HAS MADE A POINT OF NOT.RESPONDING TO DONALD TRUMP EVERY.TIME HE HAS TRIED TO BAIT.SENATOR CRUZ INTO HAVING A.DISCUSSION ABOUT SOMETHING THAT.DONALD TRUMP CLEARLY THINKS WILL.HURT HIM AS WE HEAD CLOSER TO.THE VOTE..IT'S CLEARLY THE STRATEGY OF.SENATOR CRUZ THAT HE'S NOT GOING.TO STOP A GOOD THING..THAT WAS CLEAR IN THE.CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD ABOUT.THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE..WATCH THIS..SPEAKING OF THE CONSTITUTION,.YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT DONALD.TRUMP IS BRINGING UP THE FACT.THAT YOU WERE BORN IN CANADA AND.SAYING THAT IF YOU'RE THE.REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, IT COULD BE.HELD UP IN A COURT FOR TWO.YEARS..YOU'RE A CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLAR..YOU'VE ARGUED BEFORE THE SUPREME.COURT..WHY DO YOU THINK, ON THE LEGAL.BASIS, HE'S WRONG?.>> LOOK, THE LEGAL ISSUE IS.STRAIGHTFORWARD..THE SON OF A U.S. CITIZEN BORN.ABROAD IS A NATURAL-BORN.CITIZEN..>> Reporter: BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN.TESTED..>> THE CONSTITUTION IN LAW OF.THE UNITED STATES IS.STRAIGHTFORWARD..THE VERY FIRST CONGRESS DEFINED.THE CHILD OF THE U.S. CITIZEN.BORN ABROAD AND MANY MEMBERS.WERE FRAMERS OF THE.CONSTITUTION..AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS A.NONISSUE BUT MY RESPONSE, AS YOU.AND I WERE TALKING ABOUT A FEW.MINUTES AGO, I TWEETED A LINK TO.A VIDEO OF FONZIE JUMPING A.SHARK..I'M NOT GOING TO ENGAGE IN THIS..AND THE REASON IS SIMPLE..THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY SERIOUS.ISSUES FACING THIS COUNTRY..LAST NIGHT, NORTH KOREA CLAIMS.TO HAVE TESTED A HYDROGEN BOMB..WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE.LOOKING FOR IS WHO IS PREPARED.FOR COMMANDER IN CHIEF?.WHO HAS THE SERIOUSNESS, THE.JUDGMENT, WHO HAS THE KNOWLEDGE,.THE CLARITY OF VISION --.>> LET'S BUTTON THIS UP, THOUGH..JUST ON THE ISSUE OF THE.PASSPORT..>> WHAT PASSPORT?.>> DONALD TRUMP IS SUGGESTING --.SAYING THAT YOU HAD A CANADIAN.PASSPORT..>> IT'S NOT TRUE..>> FALSE?.>> YES..>> YOU'VE NEVER HAD ONE?.>> YES, I'M SURE I HAVE NEVER.HAD ONE..>> SO CLEARLY TRYING TO PUT THAT.QUESTION TO REST..UNCLEAR HOW SUCCESSFUL HE'S.GOING TO BE BECAUSE DONALD.TRUMP, AS WE SAW IN YOUR.INTERVIEW, WOLF, IS DETERMINED.TO KEEP THIS UP..AND AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE IOWA.CAUCUSES, TED CRUZ AND WE'RE IN.A VERY RURAL PART..HE'S REACHING COUNTIES THAT A.LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T EVEN BOTHER.GOING TO BECAUSE HE'S TRYING TO.GET AN INSURANCE POLICY ON.WINNING THE CAUCUSES HERE..IT'S KIND OF AN ODD SITUATION..EXPECTATIONS ARE PRETTY HIGH FOR.HIM TO ACTUALLY WIN HERE..SO HE'S GOT TO MEET THOSE.EXPECTATIONS IF HE WANTS TO.CONTINUE IN THIS CONTEST TO NEW.HAMPSHIRE AND SOUTH CAROLINA AND.BEYOND..BUT I HAD SOME INTERESTING.CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM AIDES AND.CAMPAIGN STAFF ABOUT THE TEAM.THAT THEY ARE BUILDING, WHICH WE.CAN TALK ABOUT IN THE DAYS AND.WEEKS TO COME..>> WE CERTAINLY WILL..DANA BASH IN IOWA, THANKS VERY.MUCH..>>> WE ALSO HEARD DONALD TRUMP.TELL ME THAT TED CRUZ CAN.RESOLVE THIS RELATIVELY QUICKLY.AND GET A RULING FROM THE.FEDERAL JUDGE WHETHER INTO FACT.YOU ARE ELIGIBLE TO SERVE AS.PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES..GLORIA, WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO.WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM SENATOR.CRUZ?.>> I THINK TED CRUZ IS BEING.SMART ABOUT THIS..HE'S NOT GOING TO TAKE THE BAIT.FROM DONALD TRUMP..HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THERE'S.NOTHING IN IT FOR HIM TO GET.INTO AN ARGUMENT WITH DONALD.TRUMP ABOUT WHETHER HE HAS THE.CITIZENSHIP RIGHTS TO RUN FOR.THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED.STATES..HE DEFLECTED THE ISSUE AND.ANSWERED IT VERY FIRMLY TO DANA.AND SAID, LOOK, THERE ARE MORE.IMPORTANT THINGS OUT THERE THAT.WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT AND.I'M THE SERIOUS PERSON IN THIS.RACE..I'M NOT THE POSTURER..I'M SERIOUS..AND THESE ARE DANGEROUS TIMES.AND MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT.NORTH KOREA AND THE HYDROGEN.BOMB..SO I THINK THAT HE'S PLAYING.THIS IN A VERY SMART WAY..HE'S THE FRONT RUNNER RIGHT NOW.IN IOWA AND DOESN'T WANT TO GET.OFF TRACK..>> RYAN LIZZA, HOW LONG DO YOU.EXPECT TRUMP TO RIDE THIS ISSUE?.>> I THINK ONCE HE GETS INTO AN.ISSUE AND SEES PEOPLE TALKING.ABOUT IT, HE RIDES IT AS FAR AS.HE CAN GO..FRANKLY, I THINK THIS IS THE.FIRST WEEK THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS.BEEN SCARED..HE'S DONE TWO THINGS THAT HAS.LAUNCHED THAT..HE'S LAUNCHED AN AD CAMPAIGN IN.IOWA AFTER BRAGGING ABOUT FREE.MEDIA AND NOW HE IS ATTACKING.TED CRUZ ON AN ISSUE THAT,.FRANKLY, IS KIND OF SILLY..IT'S BEEN PRETTY -- MOST LEGAL.SCHOLARS AGREE THAT TED CRUZ IS.LEGAL TO BE PRESIDENT..IT'S TRUE THAT THE SUPREME COURT.HAS NEVER ADDRESSED THIS SO.THERE'S A VERY SMALL SHADOW OF A.DOUBT..IF TRUMP WANTED TO RESOLVED.THIS, THEY WOULD BE DAMAGED BY.THE CAMPAIGN AND HE COULD GO TO.COURT POTENTIALLY AND SUE CRUZ.OVER THIS..I THINK THAT WOULD BE A SIGN.THAT HE THINKS THIS IS A REAL.ISSUE..WHAT HE'S REALLY TRYING TO DO IS.GET US TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT.THAT CRUZ IS SOMEHOW FOREIGN..BEFORE THIS ISSUE, HE TALKED.ABOUT CRUZ BEING FROM CUBA AND.NOT BEING A REAL EVANGELICAL.BECAUSE HE'S FROM CUBA AND.TRYING TO PAINT THIS GUY AS.SOMEONE OTHER THAN A REAL.AMERICAN..>> MICHAEL SMERCONISH, DONALD.TRUMP WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID.THERE ARE DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS.WHO WANT TO GO TO COURT AGAINST.TED CRUZ ON THIS WHOLE SO-CALLED.BIRTHER ISSUE..>> DONALD TRUMP MORE THAN ANYONE.ELSE I CAN THINK OF WAS.INSTRUMENTAL IN CONVINCING 43%.OF REPUBLICANS THAT BARACK OBAMA.IS A MUSLIM..AND SO NOW HE'S TRYING TO DO THE.EXACT SAME THING WITH REGARD TO.TED CRUZ AS A CANADIAN..WILL IT BE SUCCESSFUL?.I'M LISTENING TO THE.CONVERSATION AND THERE ARE SUCH.PARALLELS OF CONVERSATIONS.PASSED RELATIVELY TO PRESIDENT.OBAMA, THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.IS HOW TO PAINT TED CRUZ AS AN.OTHER AND IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE.STRATEGY WITH THE GOP PERTAINING.TO THE PRESIDENT..WILL IT WORK WITH REGARD TO.CRUZ?.PROBABLY WITH SOME..I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT IT WILL.PLAY WELL WITH TOO MANY BUT IT.DOESN'T NEED THAT MANY, DOES HE?.>> RON BROWNSTEIN, LET ME SWITCH.GEARS..WE HEARD FROM VICE PRESIDENT.BIDEN IN AN INTERVIEW..HE EXPRESSED REGRETS FOR NOT.THROWING HIS HAT INTO THE.PRESIDENTIAL RING..I SAID, ANY REGRETS?.HE SAID I REGRET IT EVERY DAY.BUT IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION.FOR ME AND MY FAMILY..HE SAID, YOU'VE GOT TWO GOOD.CANDIDATES..I GUESS HE WAS NOT REFERRING TO.MARTIN O'MALLEY AS THE THIRD.CANDIDATE..WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THAT,.RON?.>> WANTING TO BE PRESIDENT IS A.BUD THAT NEVER ENTIRELY GETS.CURED..WHAT IT TAKES BY RICHARD BEN.CRAMER IS A GREAT BOOK AND TOM.DONLAN SAYS WHAT IT TAKES IS.EVERYTHING AND AT THAT POINT JOE.BIDEN WAS NOT IN A POSITION TO.GIVE IT EVERYTHING IN THE RACE..I THINK HE MADE THE RIGHT.DECISION FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY..>> I AGREE AND I'M NOT SURPRISED.THAT HE REGRETS IT BECAUSE HE'S.THE SITTING VICE PRESIDENT OF.THE UNITED STATES BUT, AS RON.SAYS, THIS WASN'T THE RIGHT TIME.FOR BIDEN OR FOR HIS FAMILY,.WHICH HE'S STILL GRIEVING OVER.THE DEATH OF HIS SON AND I THINK.HE ALSO THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE.VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO WIN.GETTING IN THIS LATE..SO DOES HE REGRET IT?.ABSOLUTELY..EVERY PERSON WHO","{'lan': 'ENG', 'src': 'UCLA Library', 'dur': '1:59:53.69', 'col': 'Communication Studies Archive, UCLA', 'path': '2016-01-06_2200_US_CNN_Situation_Room.txt'}"
