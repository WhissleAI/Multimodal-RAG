movies and we will take them on with our league of super heroes. actress, melissa joan hart from cnn\\'s quest means business, richard quest. model and reality tv star carmen carrera. actor and singer titus burgess. from the morning radio show bethany watson. cnn anchor john berman. from fusion\\'s, \"no, you shut up\" paul f. tomkins and from hln\\'s \"morning express,\" robin meade. it\\'s \"all the best, all the worst\" 2015.\\n\\nwelcome. i\\'m tom foreman. we could have used some superheros to help us through the challenges of this year. some exasperating, some exhilarating and some comical. and over the next hour we\\'re going to go through all of them, starting with the best and worst in the world of big news. ♪\\n\\nit was a year of firsts.\\n\\ni think a lot of people who predicted a lot of things were wrong.\\n\\ni cannot believe it is the end of the year already.\\n\\nit\\'s been weird. some weird stuff happened.\\n\\nkind of horrifying in terms of some headlines.\\n\\nthe worst way to start came in the first few days of january with the terror attacks on the french paper \"charlie hebdo.\" add in the attacks on paris later, and indeed around the world, and you get the worst story of the year, the persistent plague of terrorism.\\n\\nthere is no doubt we are dealing here with a very different beast. something that we\\'ve not seen before. something which does not follow any form of normal social norms, or even, even by the perversions of terrorism. this is absolutely out of the pale.\\n\\nyou feel hopeless. you feel scared. all you can do is post a picture of the eiffel tower inside a peace sign and put it on instagram. what else can you do?\\n\\nthe official response to isis. more than 8,000 coalition air strikes since they began last year including one that officials say killed the infamous jihadi john and the best personal reaction to it all.\\n\\nthat boy, that dad.\\n\\nvicious assaults came closer to home. mass shoot somethings rocked a school in oregon, a planned parenthood clinic in colorado, and many other places, including san bernardino, california, where a shooting at an office gathering as the year wound down reignited fears of domestic terrorism.\\n\\nany time you hear about a mass shooting, whether it is a school or a church, it is like really, really sad. it goes to show you that sometimes you\\'re not in control.\\n\\nin charleston, south carolina, a massacre at a church prayer meeting struck many people very hard.\\n\\nwhat was so uplifting, and amaze, actually, was, i\\'m going to say, their faith in action. that congregation afterward. ♪ amazing grace how sweet the sound ♪\\n\\nmost graceful move in the aftermath. the relatively swift move by south carolina to bow to pressure and take the rebel flag off of permanent official display.\\n\\nthat felt like one of those, like problem came up, we banned it, it\\'s over with. and as a society, it felt like we were like, next. next problem.\\n\\nnot exactly. this year, the worst domestic problem that seemed almost unsolvable, racial tension.\\n\\nwe are hearing again and again from the african-american community is they do not feel as if they are being treated equally or with the respect by law enforcement as everyone else.\\n\\nin baltimore, the death of a black man in police custody set off days of unrest. other cases in other places followed. many of them shocking. and polls now show almost half of all americans think race is a big problem. that\\'s a 20-year high. and as police inquiries mount --\\n\\nit used to be more than just laying people off, suspended without pay, more than that. that\\'s not enough. because they need to be made an example out of. they need to fear the repercussions of treating people as though they were not human beings.\\n\\nthe worst backlash, police officers seemingly being targeted, shot at and in some cases killed.\\n\\nonce that happened, i was so afraid. because if everyone is rebelling against the police, then who is going to protect us?\\n\\nworst case of trying too hard to empathize. the white woman in spokane who passed herself off as black with a local chapter of the naacp. i identify as black, she said.\\n\\ni was like, there is no way this is real. this story is not real. they got a woman to pose for these pictures. this is crazy.\\n\\nbest way to cool everyone off or worst, depending on how you saw it, the crushing snowfalls that hammered the northeast.\\n\\nit was the winter that never ended. every time we turned around. poor boston.\\n\\nit kept on snowing and snowing and snowing. my sister\\'s roof leaked. my mother\\'s door was frozen shut. i think they still haven\\'t cleared off last year\\'s snow this year.\\n\\nbad weather in the form of hurricanes, typhoons and droughts battered the world. southern california saw water shortages from the orchards to the freeways.\\n\\ni have not washed my car in months and months. so i just want you to know, i\\'m taking one for the team. i have started referring to almonds as conflict nuts.\\n\\nby november, 2015 was shaping up to be the warmest year on record and the best agument yet for addressing global climate change.\\n\\ndidn\\'t the pope talk about it even? the pope!\\n\\nthe pope!\\n\\ngod bless america.\\n\\nhuge crowds turned out to greet the best tour as francis made a holy roll up the east coast.\\n\\ni love the pope.\\n\\nthis pope out of all the other popes looks the most friendliest. reich you want to get to know him. he looks like a cool guy. it was interesting to see a pope sell out madison square garden faster than taylor swift.\\n\\nbest moment when that little girl ran up to the popemobile. best surprise, the pope rides in a fiat.\\n\\nworst advocate for world peace, russian president, vladmir putin, continued to hold ukraine and crimea and started a bombing campaign in syria.\\n\\nright now, vladmir putin is doing what he will and everyone else is having to sit around and watch.\\n\\nbest breakthrough for advocates of gay rights. supreme court ruling that same-sex marriages are constitutionally protected.\\n\\nwe do need to fix the fact that judgment from the supreme court is not enforceable on the local level so we can get rid of these, what\\'s her name? kim davis.\\n\\nworst setback for advocates of human rights. the strong push from many states against taking in syrian refugees.\\n\\ni get people being afraid and i get fear and i understand the panic of we can\\'t let people in, because we don\\'t have time to determine who is a real refugee and who is pretending to be a refugee so they can infiltrate our country and blow stuff up.\\n\\ni think that\\'s what our country is kind of like -- is kind of all about. you know, is giving opportunities to other people and having a safe place to go to live freely.\\n\\nworst health plan. the effort by some parents to stop measles vaccination for their kids despite overwhelming medical evidence that the shots are safe.\\n\\nas a mother i say, i always listen to my doctor.\\n\\nworst hamburger helper. the woman who aided the escape of those two inmates in upstate new york, setting off a deadly manhunt.\\n\\nnow here we come to find out that in frozen hamburger, she smuggled in these different pieces of machinery that they ended up using to get out.\\n\\nworst way to escape environmental responsibility. volkswagen admits some cars had software installed to cheat emissions tests.\\n\\nyou designed a car to cheat. it is really unbelievable.\\n\\nbest way to embrace responsibility, the first women to complete the army ranger training course.\\n\\nthat was one of those moments where as a woman, you are like, yeah, we can do this.\\n\\nworst air catastrophe.\\n\\nthe german wings plane that was purposely crashed into the alps by a disturbed pilot killing all aboard.\\n\\nand in the indian ocean, as sad as it was, the discovery of a part from that missing malaysia air flight.\\n\\nthe flaperon found on reunion was important, because it confirmed what we had always been told, which is that the plane had crashed in the southern indian ocean.\\n\\nbest thing way down in the ground. the discovery of that extraordinary ancient burial site in a south african cave that is even now rewriting the story of humankind\\'s development.\\n\\nthey had to advertise for tiny scientists who weren\\'t claustrophobic, because they had to fit through 7 1/2 inches of space. i\\'m like, that\\'s like this. and i -- hell, no.\\n\\nthe best thing way out at sea, the man who was found after 66 days adrift off the carolinas in a broken boat.\\n\\nhow the hell did he do that? like thank god he\\'s okay. but, wow.\\n\\nbest thing in the heavens above.\\n\\ni was kind of obsessed with the blood, super eclipsed moon.\\n\\nin a year full of dark moments the rare celestial show brought spectacular moments of light and dark.\\n\\nwe have many more bright spots ahead. coming up, hollywood stars go looking for gold in a galaxy far, far away. and while dinosaurs ran through the theaters, on the political stage, the roaring came from trumpoosaurus rex. it\\'s all the best. all the worst, 2015. 20160101001321.068|20160101001537.938', metadata={'source':
